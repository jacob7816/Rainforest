   Toro (TTC) Q4 2013 Earnings Call December  5, 2013 11:00 AM ET 
 Operator 
 Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Toro Company Fiscal 2014 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Earnings Conference Call. My name is Britney and I'll be the coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today, Ms. Amy Dahl, Managing Director of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations for the Toro Company. Please proceed, Ms. Dahl. 
 Amy Dahl 
 Thank you, Britney and good morning. Our earnings release was issued earlier this morning by Business Wire and a copy can be found on the investor information page of our corporate website, thetorocompany.com. 
 Joining me for this earnings call are Mike Hoffman, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Renee Peterson, Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer; and Tom Larson, Vice President and Corporate Controller. 
 We begin with our customary forward-looking statement policy. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our business and future financial and operating results. You are all aware of the inherent difficulties, risks and uncertainties in making predictive statements. Our earnings release, as well as our SEC filings detail some of the important risk factors that may cause our actual results to differ from those in our predictions. Please note that we do not have a duty to update our forward-looking statements. 
 And with that, I will now turn the call over to Mike. 
 Michael J. Hoffman 
 Thank you, Amy, and greetings to all our listeners. This morning, we were pleased to report that the company delivered record-setting results for the 2013 fiscal year, including records for revenues, operating earnings and earnings per share. We achieved a 4.2% increase in net sales, surpassing the $2 billion level for the first time in our company's history. Our operating earnings grew to $230.7 million and we delivered earnings per share of $2.62. Crossing the $2 billion revenue mark is a gratifying way to help kick off the coming year, in which we will celebrate another important milestone, the 100th anniversary of our founding on July 10, 1914. As we prepare for our second century, the company's focus on both creating and returning value to our shareholders, remain steadfast. Renée will detail our financial and operating results in a few minutes. 
 Turning to our individual businesses. First, as you may recall, our golf equipment sales get off to a very strong start during the first half of the year and in particular, during the first quarter. The early surge was fueled by channel demand for pre-Tier 4 products. As we commented then, this would even out later in the year and it did, while our early professional golf equipment shipments showed little sign of being hampered by the adverse weather, golf course revenues felt the pinch as conditions kept golfers off the links. According to the PGA tracking reports, the industry's days open for play were down nationally by 6.7% for the year, which translates to approximately 17 fewer golfing days than in 2012. Golfers, however, proved their resilience as rounds played for the year declined by only 5%. As weather conditions improved during the latter half of the year, play increased, which helped golf course total revenues recover and finish essentially flat for the year. As we've mentioned during previous calls, our new lightweight fairway mower, the Reelmaster 3550 continues to enjoy widespread acceptance. 
 The Irrigation side of our golf business is benefiting from system upgrades and replacements. During the year, we earned a number of significant systems installation projects and increased our position in the advanced sensor field. Overall product performance and the stability and strength of our distribution channel are critical factors in our golf equipment and irrigation market success. During 2013, they certainly helped us earn the opportunity to extend agreements with many long-term customers, as well as establishing promising new ones with several high-profile premier venues and events around the world, all of which we are honored to serve. 
 Moving to our landscape contractor business, the robust retail activity reported last quarter slowed somewhat in September due to a lack of moisture but rebounded in October to finish an already strong year on a positive note especially in the professional zero-turn product category. Similarly, our professional grounds product sales grew nicely in fiscal 2013 on top of what you may remember was a good 2012 season. This was driven in part by improved revenues for tax-supported entities. In their continued drive for efficiency, these customers are finding the productivity solutions they seek in our wider array of products. As a result, Toro continues to be added to many states and local government contracts. This helped increase our professional grounds business sales in 2013 and should bode well for business in 2014. 
 While we are still in the transition phase between pre-Tier 4 and Tier 4 final products, we are pleased with the early demand for our Tier 4 qualified offerings. Those professional grounds customers who are committed to green practices are likely to move to models equipped with our latest emission controls. They also see the value of added innovations like our patent-pending smart power system. While overall industry shipments are flat in the category, our share position remains strong. 
 Like professional grounds, our professional construction and rental businesses drove strong growth, finishing the year with a solid fourth quarter, fueled by increased retail activity across the key markets. We are now in production on all of our new Red underground products, which we officially launched this fall at the International Construction and Utility Equipment Exposition in Louisville. Our product line has been well received. We are successfully signing on new dealers and we have ongoing opportunities with several national account prospects. 
 Next our residential and commercial irrigation and professional lighting businesses delivered steady performance. We continued to achieve increased installation of our new unique lighting offerings due to customer demand for our innovative new products, as well as increased distribution. Our residential equipment business experienced some ups and downs throughout the year. Unfavorable spring weather reduced early-season market demand for walk power mowers, leading to sales being down for the year. On the other hand, our residential zero-turn riding mowers, which are enjoying growth due to customers switching from traditional riders, delivered strong results for the year. Summer retail for spring goods were strong for most product categories due to the eventual arrival of spring-like weather particularly for our zero-turn mowers. Fall retail sales mirror those that we saw in the landscape contractor business, slowing in September due to limited rainfall and then recovering again in October. We enjoyed strong fall retail results of electric blowers. The fact that 3 Toro models received the top rankings from a leading consumer rating magazine and we are all rated best buys may account to drive these blower sales. 
 Finally, snow sales for the fourth quarter were up due to increased pre-season demand and interest generated by our snow risk promotional campaign. On the international scene, the global economic recovery continues its modest pace with widely varying regional conditions. Our golf and grounds equipment businesses made gains in parts of Asia and Europe during the quarter, and the year and demand remains strong for our micro irrigation products. In Europe, our sales experience suggest that residential customers are increasingly adopting zero-turn riding equipment and our new value priced two-stage snow throwers also were well received. Dry conditions helped to boost sales of our Pope and golf irrigation products in Australia and in addition, our international team made their first sales of underground construction products, helping to build momentum in that category. In spite of the modest economic recovery in Europe and water restrictions in parts of the United States, our micro-irrigation business remains solid in core markets and we are expanding our presence worldwide. The business achieved growth for both the quarter and the year, benefiting from strong demand for fall planting and increased capacity. As we announced in September, we completed our acquisition of Xiamen Water Saving Equipment Company in Xiamen City, China, which will enable us to grow our presence in that important market. 
 So overall, it was a good year for the Toro Company. Our professional businesses delivered consistently strong numbers across product categories and residential sales recovered as expected as the weather patterns improved during the year. 
 I'll now turn the call over to Renée to detail our financial and operating results. 
 Renee J. Peterson 
 Thank you, Mike and good morning, everyone. Sales for fiscal 2013 grew to $2,041.4 billion compared to $1,958.7 billion for fiscal 2012. We achieved net earnings for the year of $154.8 million or $2.62 per share. This compares to fiscal 2012 earnings of $129.5 million or $2.14 per share. Net sales for the quarter were $382.4 million compared to $339.3 million for the same period a year ago. We delivered net earnings of $5 million or $0.08 per share, compared to breaking even in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. 
 For the first quarter of 2014, we expect net earnings of about $0.35 per share, compared to $0.53 per share during the first quarter of fiscal 2013, when demand for pre-Tier 4 products significantly accelerated shipments into the quarter, which as we stated at the time, will not be repeated in fiscal 2014. This year, we expect those sales to return to a more traditional second and third quarter pattern. In addition, you might recall that in the first quarter last year, we realized a $0.05 benefit to our earnings per share from the retroactive reenactment of the domestic research tax credit, which also will not be repeated in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. For the year, we repurchased approximately 2 million shares of company stock at an average price of about $46 for a total cost of about $99 million. This includes roughly 420,000 shares in the fourth quarter at $23 million. At year end, we have approximately 4.3 million shares outstanding under authorization. We expect the reduction in the number of diluted shares will be somewhat less in the year ahead than in fiscal 2013. 
 Our professional segment sales were up 7.2% to $1,425.3 billion for the year. This includes 11.9% growth for the quarter to $255.8 million. Strong demand for landscape contract equipment and higher sales of golf equipment and irrigation solutions, construction and rental offerings, commercial grounds equipment, and micro-irrigation products, all contributed to the growth. Domestic professional equipment, field inventory finished up for the year, primarily due to channel demand for pre-Tier 4 commercial equipment and expansion of our rental and construction business. Professional segment earnings were $254.4 million for the year, up 9.6% compared to fiscal 2012. Professional segment net earnings for the quarter totaled $21.8 million, a 5% increase compared to last year. 
 Our residential segment sales for the year decline 2.1% to $594.4 million. This change is attributed to a decrease in walk power mower sales caused by unfavorable spring weather and lower snow throwers sales last winter. The fourth quarter saw residential sales rise 14.3% from a year ago to $116.6 million, which is attributable to a favorable pre-season shipment of snow throwers compared to a year ago, along with increased demand across several spring product categories. For the year, residential segment earnings, net earnings were $62 million, up 7.2% from last year. Residential net earnings for the quarter totaled $10.1 million, up $3.4 million from last fourth quarter. Due to product mix and improved retail demand for snow, lower commodity costs and productivity improvements. 
 Now, on to our key operating results. Gross margin for the year was up 110 basis points to 35.5%. For the quarter, gross margin improved 30 basis points to 33.6%. Product mix influenced our margin results for both the quarter and the year along with price increases on professional products and benefits from our productivity initiative efforts. Margin expansion for both the quarter and the year was somewhat offset by unfavorable currency exchange rates. While we will likely see a similar drag from exchange rates in fiscal 2014, we anticipate gross margin improvement by up to 50 basis points. SG&amp;A expense as a percent of sales increased by 30 basis points for the full year on a sales increase of 4.2%. This increase was due to engineering expense, offset by warranty improvement. SG&amp;A decreased by 70 basis points for the quarter against a 12.7% increase in sales. For fiscal 2014, we expect SG&amp;A to be slightly better as a percent of sales. 
 Other income for the year was up $4.7 million to $12.3 million. This increase was primarily due to a one-time legal recovery, which contributed $0.03 to our after-tax earnings per share, as well as lower foreign currency losses and higher income from our channel financing joint venture, Red Iron Acceptance. 
 Operating earnings as a percent of sales improved 80 basis points to 11.3% for the year, including a fourth quarter increase of 100 basis points to 2.2%. While we anticipate that our Destination 2014 focus on productivity as a means of achieving profit improvement will continue to have a positive effect on our operating earnings next year. Interest expense declined for the year by 4.1% to $16.2 million. Interest expense for the quarter was down 5.2% from the same period a year ago to $3.9 million. Our effective tax rate for the year was 31.7% compared to 34% last year due to the retroactive reenactment of the domestic research tax credit. We expect our tax rate for fiscal 2014 to be about 33%. 
 Turning to the balance sheet, accounts receivables at the end of the year totaled $157.2 million, an increase of 6.6% compared to fiscal 2012 against sales growth of 4.2%. Net inventories were down 4.4% to $240.1 million. Trade payables increased 9.1% to $136.2 million. 
 Finally, commodity prices remain generally favorable for the year and we anticipate limited inflationary pressure that will be offset by both internal and supplier productivity improvements. As you know, we remained focused on inventory, accounts receivables and trade payable management. At the end of the year, the company's 12-month average net working capital as a percent of sales was above last year's level coming in at 16.6%. We will continue our focus on working capital in 2014 with the goal of driving it down from current levels. While we expect average inventory level to be lower next year, our capital expenditures are projected to be about $65 million on additional investments in product research and development capabilities and capacity. We expect next year's depreciation and amortization to be about $50 million. Free cash flow next year is expected to be approximately $150 million. As noted in the earnings release, we are pleased to announce that in light of our consistently strong levels of cash flow, the Board of Directors has increased our regular quarterly cash dividend by 43% to $0.20 per share from our previous rate of $0.14 per share. In addition, we're changing our dividend guideline to increase it to 30% to 40% of the 3-year average of our earnings per share results. In fiscal 2013, the company paid $32.5 million in dividends. When added to the more than 2 million shares of repurchased common stock, we returned a total of more than $130 million to our shareholders for the year. These actions are consistent with our focus on returning value to shareholders. With that said, our overall investment priorities remain the same. We continue to look internally and then through strategic acquisition opportunities to drive profitable growth. 
 I'll now turn the call back to Mike for his concluding comments. 
 Michael J. Hoffman 
 Thank you, Renee. We're gratified to have delivered record revenues, operating earnings and earnings per share along with increasing our dividend for 2014. While there are no guarantees of favorable weather and economic conditions, we look forward to delivering another strong showing in fiscal 2014 by focusing on those things we can control. Our positive outlook is based in part and our belief that customers will continue to respond to our steady introductions of innovative products and services to, as our purpose statement pledges, help them enhance the beauty, productivity and sustainability of the land. Since 1914, innovation has been the lifeblood of this company and is appropriately identified as such in the tagline of our official centennial logo, a century of innovation. In fact, as you know, we have a standing goal of driving 35% of sales annually from new products, which we defined as products introduced in the current and previous 2 fiscal years. During fiscal 2013, our new product sales were slightly below our target level, which was due in part to the significant investment we made to meet Tier 4 compliant standards. We are projecting new product sales in fiscal 2014 will once again exceed our goal. Our commitment to innovation is reflected in the recognition several of our latest product and service innovations have received from a number of authoritative bodies. Our SmartSpeed ZS also received a 2013 innovation award from Handy Club, a magazine of America. Irrigation Association recognized our new Evolution series controller with a new product award at the 2013 Irrigation Show in November and this was the third year in a row we brought home a new product contest award from the irrigation industry's premier annual show. 
 In November, the Minnesota High Tech Association honored Toro for providing superior technology innovation and leadership with the 2013 Tekne award for our revolutionary site assessment system. This provides golf course superintendents and sports fields' managers detailed evaluations of their venue's ergonomic conditions and needs so they can prescribe the most effective care regimens. Also in November, the American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers named Exmark, the winner of their annual AE 50 award for the Lazer Z mowers featuring Red technology, an award presented for innovative new products that bring advanced technology to the marketplace. Finally, on November 18, Toro was named the Home Depot Canada's 2013 Lawn and Garden Supplier of the Year at their annual supplier partnership meeting in Toronto. In 2012, we were honored with the same award for the U.S. market. These awards provide fitting testimony to our fundamental focus on excellence in the products and services we provide. However, we do not take such recognition for granted and continually strive to enhance all our businesses performance levels beyond that, which we have earned with these important accolades and have gotten us to where we are today. Such efforts have us well positioned to take advantage of opportunities ahead in 2014 so let's take a few minutes to consider the prospects for each business. 
 First, in golf with rounds played being down last year, we realized some customers may be conservative with their purchases in 2014. They will continue to look for ways to reduce operational costs and seek products to help them do that. Even with many of our engineering dollars being tied up in Tier 4 development projects in recent years, we are still introducing other new innovative products for 2014 that will help courses increase their productivity and thus, manage expenditures. Examples include our Multi Pro 1750 sprayer, which is a smaller version of the successful Multi Pro 5800 and the Sand Pro Z that incorporates the speed of a zero-turn mower into a bunker rig. With this patented rig pivoting system, the new Sand Pro has been shown to reduce the time it takes to prepare a bunker by up to 30% and enable operators to increase their daily output. Enhancing productivity is equally important to our contracted customers, who enthusiastically welcome several new product offerings we unveiled during the Green Industry Expo, the last week of October. These introductions included an expanded line of electronic fuel injected propane-powered mowers. Our new Horizon intelligence technology on zero-turn mowers that enhances the overall performance while monitoring engine temperature and the oil pressure to ensure engine longevity, the new Toro power curve commercial snowblower with our revolutionary curved rotor technology that has been helping homeowners power through tough snow conditions for nearly 3 decades. These new blowers feature extended life commercial-grade rotors that are designed to last twice as long as those of our consumer rated models. And rounding out our new landscape contractor offerings is a completely reengineered line of 21-inch commercial heavy-duty walk power mowers that provide superior quality of cut, easy empty bags, premium engines and maintenance pre-transmissions to keep crews on-the-job and out of the service shop. With commercial and residential construction investment projected to continue to expand, the outlook for growth for our professional construction and rental businesses looks similarly strong for 2014. The timing is fortuitous for our new construction line that we'll see as first full year in the market in 2014. Of course, increased construction is also a good news for residential business. While we always welcome favorable weather, we cannot count on the accuracy of forecast from key weather services that are predicting good snowfall amounts for December. These forecasts are accurate as they have proven to be in Minnesota this week. Such timely snow would likely help accelerate retail activity. Our new compact two-stage lineup is poised for market success across the snow belt assuming normal levels of snowfall occur. 
 Our spring products lineup for 2014 features 3 new zero-turn mowers, a new Toro recycle walk power mower with a space savings SmartShell feature and an all new Lawn-Boy walk power mower line. These new products and strong marketing programs will all enhance sales prospects for the coming year. We're also optimistic about the growth opportunities for our residential and commercial irrigation business based on the positive housing news and exciting product advancements like our award-winning evolution controllers. Our professional lighting business is yet another likely benefactor of improved housing conditions. We are ready with outstanding new products, including our Light Logic wireless control system, the industry's only wireless product that controls both lighting systems and irrigation controllers with a single handheld remote. Recently, we closed on a small lighting acquisition that will increase our product portfolio and provide access into additional markets with a quality value price offering. 
 Next, our continued investments around the world in the micro-irrigation field like our recently completed acquisition in China, bolster our commitment to this growing market. As our presence has increased, so has the company's global reputation as a stable, high-quality manufacturer. That standing is supported by important advancements like our new Neptune flat emitter drip line technology that provide superior performance, resist clogging, it's easy to install in various configurations and delivers exceptional durability. Overall market factors remain favorable for long-term growth and our solid positioning will help us provide customer valued solutions for the ever-growing global demand for food and do so in a way that promotes sustainability. 
 In summary, we remain steadfast in our focus on innovation, revenue growth, gross margin and SG&amp;A improvement as we strive to achieve our Destination 2014 goals. The company expects revenue growth of about 4% to 5% for fiscal 2014 and net earnings of about $2.85, to $2.90 per share. As Renee discussed, the company expects to report net earnings for the first quarter of about $0.35 per share. I mentioned at the beginning of the call, that in 7 months, we will reach the 100th anniversary of our founding. When the company was preparing to celebrate its 1/4 century mark back in 1939, our President then, John Samuel Clapper wrote that the 25-year milestone was considerably above the average career of a business enterprise, which is still true today. Even on to say that the loyal service of Toro's employees and distributors, majority of whom had 10 or more years of service with the company, was a company's guarantee of a high-quality product. What was true 75 years ago remains true today. The loyal service of our employees and channel partners are critical to the company's success as we prepare to embark on our second century. We salute them and we thank them for their loyal service and continued support. 
 So this concludes our formal remarks, we'll now take questions at this time, so Britney, back to you.

Then we will open the call to take your questions. 
 Now I'd like to introduce the company's Chairman and CEO, Mr. David Meyer. Go ahead, David. 
 David Joseph Meyer 
 Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter of fiscal 2014 earnings conference call. As John mentioned, to help you follow today's prepared remarks, we've provided a slide presentation, which you can access on the Investor Relations portion of our website at titanmachinery.com. If you click on the Investor Relations tab on the right side of the page, you'll see the presentation directly below the webcast in the middle of the page. 
 If you turn to Slide 2, you will see our third quarter fiscal 2014 results. Our revenue for the third quarter was $588 million, a slight increase compared to the same period last year. 
 Our sales for the quarter reflect the challenges in the agricultural and construction industries, which we have discussed on previous calls and will update on today's call. 
 Pretax income was $10.1 million, and our earnings per share were $0.27. While our higher-margin Parts and Service business performed well in the third quarter, this was offset by lower equipment sales and lower equipment margins due to pricing pressure in both industries. 
 On today's call, we will review the performance of each of our segments. In addition, we will discuss agricultural equipment sales, the strengths of our Parts and Service recurring revenue and [indiscernible] margin pressure that's affecting our industry. We will update you on our equipment inventory strategy and discuss revised fiscal 2014 guidance and modeling assumptions. 
 Now I'd like to provide some more color on each of our industries that are key to our business. On Slide 3, we provide an overview of our agricultural industry. In our footprint, anticipated annual crop production has been impacted by several factors. As we discussed on our last call, 52% of U.S. corn and soybean preventive planting occurred in Titan Machinery footprint, reducing our production by 2.6 million acres. 
 Also our fall harvest is now completed with most field preparation completed as well. 
 Regarding our Eastern European footprint, favorable fall conditions allowed our customers complete their harvest and allow them to plan their fall crops. 
 USDA forecasts are protecting large crop carryover approximately 1.9 billion bushes of corn and 170 billion bushes of soybean for 2013, which is reflected in lowered global commodity prices. It's important to understand that the Eastern Corn Belt, which is outside of Titan Machinery footprint grow over the higher production yields in the U.S. and our footprint in the Western Corn Belt produced average crop yields. 
 Our new U.S. Farm program has been in the legislative process since the beginning of the year. Many people were expecting a final vote earlier this year. However, the final plan is unclear at this time, and the final vote has not been set as of today. 
 Completing the new farm program will give farmers better visibility to plan their business going forward. As a reminder, the current production year is covered by the existing farm program. 
 The Ag equipment industry is experiencing price increases in advance of Tier 4 final pricing, which is affecting overall equipment sales and is also compressing our equipment margins as we have not been able to realize full pricing in all the transactions across all product offerings. 
 The industry continues to experience pressure on used equipment prices as a result of the lower commodity prices and the current plentiful supply of used equipment in the industry. We continue to focus on managing our used equipment inventory. 
 Now I'd like to turn to the Construction segment of our business. On Slide 4, we provide an overview of the construction industry and our markets. The conditions in the third quarter were very similar to the second quarter as the sluggish economic recovery continues to impact the construction industry. Excess equipment inventories continued to impact the industry through the third quarter and are expected to continue into the first half of calendar year 2014. 
 Until industry inventories are in line with end-user demand, we will experience compressed equipment margins. 
 With our expanded distribution and large geographic footprint, there are different drivers within the 11-state geography we cover. This diversification demonstrates one of the positives we achieved through scale. 
 In the Upper Midwest, agricultural activity and the ongoing build out of the Bakken adjacent oil reserves and related infrastructure continue to support the construction industry. 
 The positive third quarter construction same-store comps we achieved are reflective of some early signs of improvements in our core CE equipment offerings. 
 An increase in year-to-date housing permits reflect the recovery in the housing industry, which has been at historic low levels. 
 Third quarter housing permits throughout the majority of our footprint are up year-over-year, which is an early indicator of demand for our medium and light equipment product offerings. We continue to see growth in rental equipment demand, which is aligned with industry forecast. 
 In fiscal 2014, we have increased the size of our rental fleet by 41% to capture a larger percent of this opportunity throughout our footprint. 
 And now turning to Slide 5, I'd like to provide an update on our Construction segment. The initiatives we outlined in our second quarter earnings call to improve our construction business are now in place. They include: We established the organizational platforms to leverage specific expertise across our distribution footprint; we made key personnel changes, which included new hires to oversee construction operations, as well as new senior managers for our aggregate, rental, industrial and government organizational platforms, along with major account managers; we are implementing the process to improved utilization of our expanded rental fleet, as we previously mentioned, we increased our fleet by 41%; we are focused on increasing sales volume per location through leverage operating expenses and drive operating margins; lastly, improving inventory management by adding centralized oversight and control. 
 As we enter our fourth quarter, we are beginning to see early signs of these initiatives are starting to have positive effects on our Construction segment. These include our same-store sales increase of 6.4% in the third quarter. 
 We continue to improve our inventory position in our Construction segment. We believe we have the organization placed[ph] to be well-positioned in fiscal 2015. 
 While we are not satisfied with our recent results, we're confident in our long-term outlook. We have a proven operating model and a well-established footprint of agriculture and construction dealerships in the U.S., as well as international presence in the Eastern Europe. 
 Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mark Kalvoda, our Chief Financial Officer, to review our financials in greater detail. 
 Mark P. Kalvoda 
 Thanks, David. Turning to Slide 6. Our total revenues for the fiscal 2014 third quarter increased slightly to $588 million. The 3.2% decrease in overall equipment sales from our Agriculture, Construction and International businesses was primarily due to the industry headwinds that David just discussed. 
 The equipment decrease was fully offset by the strength in our recurring Parts and Service revenue. 
 We also grew rental revenue on a quarter-over-quarter basis due to our extended Rental Fleet. 
 On Slide 7, our gross profit for the quarter decreased slightly to $93.6 million. Our gross profit margin was 15.9%, a decrease of 30 basis points compared to the same quarter last year. The decrease was primarily driven by equipment margin of 7.9%, which was below our expectations due to industry conditions impacting both new and used equipment margins. This was 130 basis point decline from equipment margins up 9.2% in the third quarter of last year. 
 Also impacting gross margin was a lower utilization on our Rental Fleet compared to the prior year. Lower equipment and rental margins were substantially offset by a shift in gross profit mix to our higher-margin recurring Parts and Service business. 
 Gross profit from Parts and Service for the third quarter of fiscal 2014 was 55% of overall gross profit compared to 47% in the third quarter of last year. This performance illustrates the stability and reoccurring aspect of our Parts and Service business in a softer equipment market. 
 Our operating expenses as a percentage of net sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 were 12.7% compared to 11% for the same quarter last year. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue primarily reflects lower fixed operating cost leverage due to lower same-store sales for our Agriculture segment, higher expenses related to expanding our construction and international distribution networks, as well as higher occupancy costs associated with facility improvements to support growth of our higher-margin Parts and Service business. 
 Our overall interest expense increased 30 basis points, which was driven by higher equipment inventory levels. 
 Peter will be discussing our inventory strategy in more detail later in the call. 
 Our pretax income was $10.1 million or a pretax margin of 1.7% compared to pretax income of $23.8 million and a pretax margin of 4.1% in the third quarter of last year. The quarter-over-quarter decline primarily reflects lower company equipment sales and margins, as well as higher operating and interest expenses. 
 Earnings per diluted share for fiscal 2014 third quarter was $0.27 compared to earnings per diluted share of $0.66 in the third quarter of last year. 
 Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 42.8%, and we are expecting it to be approximately 41.6% for the fourth quarter. The increase in our effective tax rate is due to projected losses in our lower tax entities in Europe. 
 On Slide 8, you will see our results for the first 9 months of fiscal 2014. Our revenue in the first 9 months of fiscal 2014 was $1.52 billion, an increase of 7.3% compared to the same period last year, reflecting growth in all 4 revenue streams for this period. 
 Turning to Slide 9. Our gross profit in the first 9 months of fiscal 2014 increased 6.9% to $251.1 million. Our gross margin was 16.5%, down 10 basis point from the comparable period last year as lower equipment margins were primarily offset by a shift in mix to higher Parts and Service revenue. 
 Our operating expenses increased 170 basis points, primarily reflecting the factors, I discussed earlier. 
 In the first 9 months of fiscal 2014, our earnings per share was $0.43 compared to $1.27 in the same period last year. 
 Turning to Slide 10. We provide an overview of our balance sheet highlights at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2014. We had cash of $113.4 million as of October 31, 2013. Our inventory level was $1.2 billion as of the end of the third quarter compared to $929 million as of the end of fiscal 2013. 
 Of the $247 million inventory increase, approximately $44.5 million was from acquisitions. New inventory, including acquisitions increased $215.8 million from the end of fiscal 2013. And our used equipment inventory, including acquisitions, increased $7.9 million from the end of fiscal 2013. 
 Peter will provide additional color on our equipment inventory. 
 Our Rental Fleet assets at the end of the third quarter were $149 million, which is up $43 million compared to the end of fiscal year 2013, but remained consistent with our second quarter. The Fleet increase from the end of fiscal 2013 was primarily in our newly expanded footprint in Colorado, New Mexico and Arizona. 
 As of October 31, 2013, we have $160 million available on our $1.05 billion floorplan lines of credit. 
 Slide 11 gives an overview of our cash flow statement for the third quarter of fiscal 2014. When we evaluate our business, we look at our cash flow related to the equipment inventory, net of financing activities, with both manufacturers and other sources, including non-manufacturer floorplan notes payable, which are reported on our statement of cash flow as both operating and financing activities. 
 When considering our non-manufacturer floorplan proceeds, our non-GAAP net cash use for inventories was $41 million in the first 9 months of fiscal 2014. 
 Our GAAP cash used for inventories was $287.4 million in the first 9 months of fiscal 2014. 
 In our statement of cash flows, the GAAP reported net cash used for operating activities for the first 9 months was $107.3 million. We believe including all equipment inventory financing as part of our operating cash flow better reflects the net cash flow of our operations. Making these adjustments, our non-GAAP adjusted cash used for operating activities was $12 million. 
 Now I would like to turn the call over to Peter to discuss the Agriculture, Construction and International operating segments in more detail, our inventory management strategy to discuss our fiscal 2014 annual guidance. Peter? 
 Peter J. Christianson 
 Thanks, Mark. On Slide 12, you'll see an overview of our segment results for the third quarter. Agricultural sales were $459 million, a decline of 4.1%. 
 We generated Ag pretax income of $10.1 million compared to $23.8 million in the prior-year period. 
 As David and Mark mentioned, the primary factors impacting our Ag segment results were lower equipment sales and margins. 
 Turning to our Construction segment. Our revenue was $109.9 million, up 15.8% which reflects higher same-store sales, as well as acquisition growth. 
 Industry conditions remain challenging for this segment of our business, which created pricing pressure, compressing our equipment margins. 
 The pretax loss of $3.1[ph] million was primarily the result of lower margins and increased expenses associated with recent acquisitions. As David commented, we're executing on our key initiatives to improve this segment of our business. 
 In the third quarter of fiscal 2014, our International revenue was $40.3 million, a 42.7% increase compared to the prior-year period. This increase reflects the acquisitions and new store openings. 
 Our pretax loss for International was $1 million compared to a pretax income of $1.4 million in the same quarter last year, reflecting costs associated with building our distribution network and ramping up operations. 
 It's important to keep in mind that our International business is still in the development stage, and we're establishing our international operations and believe this business represents an additional structural component of our long-term growth strategy. 
 Now I'll turn it to Slide 13. You'll see our segment results for the first 9 months of the year. Ag revenue growth represents acquisition growth. The decrease in our Ag pretax income reflects our lower equipment margins previously mentioned and an increase in our floorplan interest expense. 
 Our Construction segment revenues represent acquisition growth offsetting negative same-store sales growth for the 9-month period. 
 Construction pretax loss reflects lower equipment margins and higher rental and floorplan interest expense, in addition to the increased expenses associated with our recent construction acquisitions. 
 Our International segment 9 months results reflect the same factors I mentioned regarding our third quarter segment overview. 
 Turning to Slide 14. This shows our same-store results for the third quarter of fiscal 2014. Our overall same-store sales decreased 4.5%. The Agricultural same-store sales decrease of 6.5% reflects the industry headwinds David discussed earlier, as well as strong prior year same-store comps of 26.4%. 
 Our third quarter fiscal 2014 construction same-store sales increased 6.4%, reversing the trend in the first half of this year, showing early signs of the impact of our key initiatives that David discussed. 
 Our international same-store sales decreased 6.9%, reflecting the impact of lower global commodity prices. The lower commodity prices resulted in lower farm income for the crops sold this year and also resulted in the delay of a portion of the sale of crops as farmers wait to market their crop. 
 For the third quarter of fiscal 2014, overall same-store growth profit decreased 5.4%. This decline in each segment primarily reflects the lower equipment margins as discussed earlier. 
 Slide 15 shows our same-store results for the first 9 months of fiscal 2014. First 9 months same-store sales decreased 1.7% compared to the prior period -- prior-year period, and same-store gross profit decreased 0.9%. 
 For modeling purposes, it is important to remember that we calculate same-store sales by including stores that were with Titan for the entire period in which we're comparing. In other words, only stores that were a part of Titan for the entire 3 months of the third quarter of fiscal 2013, and the third quarter of fiscal 2014 are included in the third quarter same-store comparison. 
 In the third quarter of fiscal 2014, a total of 9 locations were not included in our third quarter of same-store results, consisting of 3 agricultural stores, 4 construction stores and 2 international locations. 
 For the first 9 months of fiscal 2014, a total of 23 locations were not included in our first 9 months same-store results, consisting of 6 agricultural stores, 8 construction stores and 9 international locations. 
 Turning to Slide 16. I'd like to provide an update on our equipment inventory strategy. Moving from left to right on the graph, you're seeing the inventory level at the end of the last 5 years. 
 Next are the inventory levels for each quarter of this year, including our projected year-end inventory level. 
 Finally, on the right side of the graph is the targeted year-end inventory for fiscal 2015, representing a $250 million reduction in inventory, excluding acquisitions and new store openings, compared to the end of this fiscal year. 
 Although our projected inventory decrease will be approximately $90 million in the fourth quarter from third quarter levels, we did not achieve results in line with our long-term strategy this year. 
 Orders placed during the first half of this fiscal year, combined with unanticipated lower same-store sales in the back half of this year impacted our projected year-end inventory levels. 
 Given our visibility into the current market conditions and our current inventory levels, we're in a position to affect our ordering process, promote presell activity and aggressively market our used equipment to achieve our targeted reduction of $250 million by the end of fiscal 2015, demonstrating a significant change in inventory stocking levels. We believe this reduction in equipment inventory levels will put us on track to achieve our long-term inventory goal of a 3x [ph] turn, as well as improving our cash flow and strengthening our balance sheet. 
 Slide 17 shows our fiscal 2014 annual guidance. Given the factors we've discussed in our prepared remarks, we're updating our annual guidance -- updating our annual revenue, net income and earnings per share guidance. We now expect fiscal 2014 revenue to be in a range of $2.15 billion to $2.35 billion. We expect our annual net income attributable to common stockholders to be in the range of $11.6 million to $15.8 million resulting in earnings per diluted share range of $0.55 to $0.75, based on an estimated average diluted common shares outstanding of 21.1 million shares. 
 It's important to remember that historically, our fourth quarter is our largest equipment revenue quarter. And given the market conditions we have experienced this year, it's harder to predict year-end buying activity from our customers, which has a meaningful impact on our fourth quarter results. 
 Our modeling assumption supporting our guidance are as follows. We expect our Ag same-store sales to be in the range of negative 10% to negative 5% compared to previous guidance of negative 2% to positive 3%. 
 We're maintaining our construction same-store annual growth to be in the range of negative 2% to positive 3%. 
 Our equipment margins modeling assumption for the full-year are now projected to be in the range of 8% to 8.5% compared to the previous range of 8.6% to 9.1%. 
 We're modeling annual rental dollar utilization to be approximately 30%, which is within our previous range of 30% to 32%. 
 This concludes the prepared comments for our call. Operator, we are now ready for the question-and-answer session of our call.

MLNX," 
   Mellanox Technologies, Ltd. (MLNX) Credit Suisse Annual Technology Conference December  5, 2013 11:30 AM ET 
 Unidentified Analyst 
 Good morning. Why don’t we go and get started? It’s my pleasure this morning to introduce the CFO of Mellanox Technologies, Jacob Shulman. He is going to walk through a presentation, its probably 15, maybe 20 minutes in length. We will have some time for Q&amp;A afterwards. With that, I’ll turn things over to Jacob. 
 Jacob Shulman 
 Thank you very much John. Thank you very much for having us at this conference. Before we start, I’d like kind of -- to review our Safe Harbor statement. It’s pretty straightforward. I'm sure you're all familiar with it. So, what is Mellanox? What do we do? Mellanox is a fabless semiconductor company. We design, manufacture, and sell high performance interconnect products that help to facilitate efficient data transmission between servers, storage and embedded system. 
 We headquarter – we're dually headquartered. Our R&amp;D operations in Israel. Our business headquarters in Sunnyvale, California. We have approximately 1,400 employees at the end of Q3. 2012 was a unique year for us. Our revenue hit $500 million benchmark, up 93% year-over-year from 2011. Our Q3 ’13 revenues were $104.1 million. We guided Q4 revenue from $105 million to $110 million, and with aggregate September quarter with $306.4 million in cash and investments. 
 So each compute and storage systems consists of three major blocks. CPU, memory and interconnect, the pipe that moves the data between CPU and memory. CPU is becoming more and more powerful, memory becoming powerful and faster that creates bottleneck on the interconnect. That’s why it requires high performance interconnect. So when we first came to the market, we operate 10 gigabit per second products, then the market progress to 20, 40 and today we offer 56 gigabit per second InfiniBand and Ethernet products and also offer 10, 40 Ethernet as well. 
 The debt is growing exponentially. Everyday new applications coming out that create data and help to consume data. That’s basically what creates -- that’s why people trying to deal high -- very efficient data centers with high performance interconnect because we help to facilitate data transmission between CPU and memory. 
 While the competition is -- they are moving from 1 gig to 10 gig, we’re the only guys today that offer 40 gig end-to-end and 56 gig end-to-end solutions. We first started with HPC market, but what we noticed is that same architecture that is used by HPC guys is also implemented in Web 2 and Cloud markets. That’s why in 2011 we made a decision to penetrate in those markets. 
 So Web 2 guys for us is the guys who deal super computers, one super computer to run one application and Cloud as we define Cloud is guys that’s building one super computer to run multiple applications. All of then using same infrastructure as HPC and today we’re uniquely positioned to capture those markets as well. HPC still the major market for us, although in 2013 revenue from -- deriving from HPC below 50% of total revenues. And today we also sell products in multiple markets in Web 2 database, cloud, financial services and storage. And there are various examples on the value our products provide from those markets. 
 So for example HPC, today InfiniBand is the most used interconnect in HPC market. Every six months, a list of TOP500 computers published and basically shows what systems are used in TOP500 and all of 205 systems or actually 207 systems based on November list are connected with InfiniBand. 
 Latest list was published in November ’13 and the number of InfiniBand connected systems went up from 205, in June 207 -- in November. InfiniBand today is the most used interconnect in HPC and the only Petascale proven interconnect. So if people want to build Petascale systems, they must use InfiniBand. 
 Our latest generation FDR products connected, the penetration of this product increased 3.3x from a year-ago, from 21 to 67 systems within list of TOP500. If you look at the chart at the top right corner all of this blue dots is the efficiency of systems connected with InfiniBand. So you see that the systems efficient to the rate of 80% to 90%. The yellow dots are systems that connected with 10 gigabit Ethernet. And the efficiency of those systems is around 50% to 60%. So basically people connect the HPC systems with InfiniBand, they get 50% better efficiency from the system. 
 Purdue University is a great example of file products used in HPC. They were able to build 187 Petaflops machine with only 648 servers. That’s half the server count and double performance from their previous system. 
 In the Web 2 market, we work with five major customers, we call [ph] Wales and we work with number of smaller customers typically those guys try to be very selective about what they’re doing and there are only few public examples of our success in that market. One of the examples is Bing Maps. So when Bing Maps try to build a system they had choice between our 40 gigabit InfiniBand products or competitive solution of 10 gigabit Ethernet. Again the decision was to go with 40 gigabit InfiniBand. So Bing Maps were able to get 10X performance from their prior system. They were able to achieve that at half cost compared to 10 gigabit Ethernet solution. 
 Next market for us is the Cloud. And those are -- this is a list of public examples of InfiniBand used in cloud. Today cloud for us is primarily connected with InfiniBand. The penetration in the cloud is very small right now, because typically the cloud -- our penetration in cloud lower than in Web 2 because cloud create some additional challenges to cloud vendors such as security provisioning and etcetera. And InfiniBand today helps cloud providers to build the most efficient systems, much better ROI on their investments in the system. 
 On the data center market, database market, Oracle has put on the map. Our InfiniBand technology today connects all of their Exa family products manufactured by Oracle. So any Exadata, Exalogic, Exalytic machine has our InfiniBand inside. So by selling the Exadata boxes or Exa family boxes to its customers, Oracle is able to improve performance by a factor of 10x and the customer reduce their hardware cost by a factor of 5x. 
 The next market is Storage. Storage is really Greenfield for us. We believe that our InfiniBand and Ethernet have a very good opportunity there, because we believe that fiber channel will go away. If you look at the transervers today, HPC, Web 2, Cloud, zero fiber channel in new installations. People still buy fiber channels for -- to support existing systems, but transervers today moving away from fiber channel and we believe that InfiniBand and Ethernet will take its place. 
 There are some various examples of our success in the storage business. EMC presented at our Analyst Day a year-ago and they said there are half a dozen programs we will have together with them. Some of them public like Isilon, some of them went to production, some of them expected to go into production in 2014 timeframe. Teradata presented at our Analyst Day last October just a month and half ago, they said that they moved all of their systems, all of their boxes to InfiniBand. There are some additional examples of IBM XIV and Oracle. We also work with Xyratex, NetApp and some other major vendors in storage business. Today we’re working with all Tier-1 storage OEMs. 
 We play in the big market. We estimate the size of the market by the number of end points sold in that market. We could connect all of those end points either with our InfiniBand or Ethernet products. We estimate that on annual basis approximately 14.6 million end points sold. Of them 10.6 million end points in servers, 3.4 million end points in storage and about 600k in embedded. And if we apply our estimation of ASP per endpoint of $400, we derive to $5.8 billion market [ph] end. And this market is growing. 
 We expect that in 2015 approximately 16.8 million end points will be sold and even if we assume ASP reduction of 10% from 400 to 360, we’re still talking about $6 billion market. And for us $400 ASP today is very conservative in estimation. In 2012, we shipped approximately 1.1 million devices with $500 million in revenues. The ASP per end point is at high 400s. 
 Many time people ask to our customers how much was sell to certain end-users? We do not sell directly to end-users. We fulfill or we work with hardware storage OEMs. So IBM and HP historically have been our major customers, more than 10% customers. Oracle we disclose our revenues from Oracle as well, because Oracle owns around approximately 9% of the company. Revenues from Oracle around mid single digits. Approximately 15% -- 10% to 15% of the revenue comes from distribution. And we work with multiple software partners to ensure compatibility with various operating systems. 
 We provide full end-to-end solutions. From PCI Express, from the server, through the switch to the storage, all of this connection provided by Mellanox. So we sell Silicon standalone that could go in motherboards, we sell adapter cards so that silicon could go in adapter card. Switch silicon could be sold either standalone or as switch systems. We connect all of those with our cables and we’ve standalone software that provides performance boost for the system. 
 And our gross margins really dependent on the mix of the products. So regarding higher gross margins on sales of silicon followed by boards, systems and end cables. So the more silicon we sell the high gross margins. The more cables we sell the low gross margins. 
 In contrary we announced the acquisition of -- closed acquisitions of IPtronics and Kotura. IPtronics is a Danish company. Kotura is the company in southern California. Both of these acquisitions are part of our plan to get to the next generation 100 gigabit generation and offer those products in 2014-2015 timeframe. Those as we move to higher speeds the importance of having end-to-end solution is very high. Even physics would work differently. So, we believe that copper will have limits on how long equal use of copper at the datacenter 100 Gig. We believe that copper would be good for connection within the rack, however outside the rack people would have to introduce fiber optic solutions and both Kotura and IPtronics kind of far to file future offering in fiber optics. 
 Today we have fiber optic cables VCSEL based and IPtronics is one of the components on those cables. However we believe that as we move to next generations beyond 100 Gig silicon photonics is a better technology than VCSEL, and Kotura will provide those components in silicon photonics. Also these acquisitions will allow us to significantly improve our margins on the cable products because we will prevent margins backing on those products. 
 In terms of the roadmap, again today we’re the only guys in town with 56 gig per second InfiniBand. We’re the only guys in town with 40 gigabit Ethernet end-to-end. Some people have 40 gigabit Ethernet switches. No one has 40 gigabit Ethernet NIC cards. Our main competition is Intel. Today we compete with Intel on the InfiniBand side at 40 gigabits per second InfiniBand. Intel is next generation kind behind us and they have this 40 gigabit per second InfiniBand product from their acquisition of QLogic, InfiniBand assets. 
 A few word’s about financial performance. So, assuming midpoint of our Q4 guidance, we expect to, our revenue in 2013 to be around $393 million down from $500 million in 2012. There are a few words I would like to say, explain in this what happened. So when we moved into 2012 we expected our revenue to be $360 million. But then what happened, 2012 we experienced very significant pent-up demand from Romley [ph] fair cycle. If you recall Romley, an Intel CPU was initially supposed to be launched in Q3 of 2011. It was finally (indiscernible) in March of 2012. So people delayed their purchase especially in HPC market. They delayed their purchases from 2011 to 2012 and that’s what created roughly $65 million of the pent-up demand. We believe that approximately $50 million of that number belongs really to 2011. 
 What happened again in 2012 is that, one of our largest customers, one of the OEMs we’re working with continued purchasing, assuming that the customers continued purchasing toward some of the customer programs that did not go through and that’s what basically created a build out of inventory at the OEM side, and we quantified that it's around $30 million and also there was a large Web 2 installation around $25 million in 2012 that was dedicated to some commercial application that did not work well for the Web 2.0 guy and that’s why the guy overbuilt around $25 million. 
 So, if we move $50 million to 2011 from the pent-up demand and around $50 million from the inventory built-out and overbuilt by the Web 2.0 customer, that’s what our revenue would have been. So instead of $260 million in 2011 our revenue would have been $300 million to $310 million. So the $500 in 2012 our revenue would have been around $400 million and instead of $393 million in 2013 our revenue would have been $430 million, $440 million that’s kind of more national spread of the revenues over the last three years. 
 On a quarterly basis, we have been growing throughout 2013. Obviously there is a big hump in 2012 because of the Romley refresh and those inventory build-outs that we were able to grow throughout quarter-over-quarter in 2013, and we guided our Q4 revenue between $105 million and $110 million. 
 In terms of the product mix, we’ve kind of seen product mix more or less stabilized. If back in 2008, 2009 timeframe we were mostly component vendor with revenues from silicon and boards accounted for 90% of revenues. Today silicon represents mid-teens of the revenues. Board’s around 30% of the revenues. Switch’s around mid 30s and the rest of cables, software services and other. 
 In terms of the data rate, this chart represents our distribution of the revenue by data rate. If you look the orange area is the data rate, is the FDR revenue. So today FDR represents around 50% of the revenue. Light green is Ethernet. Ethernet today is around 15% of the revenue. Around 25% comes from QDR our previous generation InfiniBand 40 Gig and I would like to note one trend that we kind of experienced here. If you look at the yellow area that’s our DDR 20 gigabit InfiniBand product, those products were launched in 2005 and in 2010 five years after the launch they represented around high single digit percent of revenue. 
 Our QDR generation 40 gigabit InfiniBand was launched in 2008 and in 2013 five years after the launch it still represents high 20s, they are 3X from DDR. The reason been is that we designed into some systems with major OEMs that create the stickiness, very sticky design wins. Guys like Oracle or [ph] Luxor Data all of them using QDR and that creates a very high barrier for competition to enter. So if, when we have competition from Intel at 100 gigabit per second , it will, they would fill out -- major OEMs will have to still forth [ph] port their software on Intel’s products which creates a very high barrier. Just to give you kind of a data point Oracle rolled to about 30 million lines of quote from our products. So when the competition comes, a significant portion of that we’ll have to be really pleased, and all of the -- have to be ed qualified. So that’s very sticky design wins that will help us in the competition. 
 In terms of the cash flow, obviously 2012 was a unique year for us. We generated $182 million in cash. We cash positive in 2013 we started the year with not effective balance sheet structure. As a result of the Q4 guidance mix we had very high inventory. To remind you we build inventory to the forecast, not to the orders and that’s how we ended with relatively high inventory levels. We worked through that inventory throughout the year-to-date. At the end of Q3 we’re back to our normal balance sheet structure and we expect to continue to generate cash flow going forward. We exited the third quarter with $306.4 million in cash and investment. 
 In terms of the long-term model; as I said 2012 was a unique year we overachieved 2013 due to the reduction in revenue in kind of fixed structure of the costs we underperformed as compared to the model. But in terms of the model we’re targeting mid-to-high 60s on the gross margins and today we are at the highest range for that highest end of the range. 
 In terms of operating expenses we target mid 40s, today we’re not there yet. We are at the mid 50s, and the strategy for us to get back to the profitability is to grow our operating expenses at the rate lower than the revenue. We still believe -- we believe that there are a lot of market opportunities for us. We want to continue to invest into the business, but we also want to get back to profitability. Therefore we’ll grow our operating expenses at the rate lower than revenue increases. This will allow us to get back to mid 20s in operating income and low 20s in the net income. 
 So just to summarize, really Interconnect is very important today to any efficient datacenter. As data growing exponentially, people try to build datacenter that could move very large amount of data and that creates the need for high performance Interconnect. We’re very well positioned in the markets we sell to Intel, HPC, Web 2, Cloud database markets. So far we have demonstrated solid revenue growth, 30% year-over-year with weighing in large market around $6 billion down. We’re building a large company. We have strong partnerships, channel relationships and we are very well positioned to grow in 2014. 
 With that, I'll turn to questions.

   Cantel Medical (CMN) Q1 2014 Earnings Call December  5, 2013 11:00 AM ET 
 Operator 
 Greetings, and welcome to the Cantel Medical Corp.'s First Quarter for Fiscal Year 2013 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Andy Krakauer, President and CEO. Thank you. You may begin. 
 Andrew A. Krakauer 
 Great. Thank you, Stacy, and welcome to our first quarter fiscal year 2014 conference call. Before we start, I'd like to remind everyone that this conference call may contained forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including, without limitations, the risks detailed in the company's filings and reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such statements are only predictions and actual results may differ materially from those projected. 
 Again, so good morning, everyone. With me on our call today are Chuck Diker, Chairman of the Board; Jorg Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Craig Sheldon, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Seth Yellin, Senior Vice President, Corporate Development. 
 Cantel Medical achieved record financial performance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2014 with solid sales and net income growth. We reported first quarter earnings of $0.27 per share as compared to the prior year's first quarter earnings of $0.23 per share. Sales increased 19% in the quarter, of which 10% was organic. Our net income increased by 17% but would have been over 23% if not for the Medical Device Tax, almost $1 million now in this quarter, which we did not have last year. 
 All 3 major segments, Endoscopy, Water Purification and Filtration and Healthcare Disposables performed well in the first quarter. 
 Our Endoscopy business had outstanding growth for the second consecutive quarter. This quarter's sales of $43.6 million were up 19% over the same quarter last year, all of which was organic growth. Operating profit for the segment on a reported basis increased by 7%. But after adjusting for unfavorable acquisition, accounting items over $400,000 and the Medical Device Tax over $400,000, operating profit growth was really in the high teens on a normalized basis. 
 We are very optimistic that our Medivators Endoscopy business will deliver good sales growth and increase operating profits for the rest of fiscal year 2014 and beyond. This quarter, we saw a nice increases in our large and growing installed base of endoscope processing equipment. And this sales growth came from both the United States and international businesses. 
 Equipment placements drive sales of our higher-margin disinfectant chemistries, much of which is our proprietary Rapicide PA product. This quarter our disinfectant and detergent Chemistries grew by 25%. Our growing installed base of machines also provides great opportunities to expand our service in spare parts business, which grew 15% this quarter. 
 On the product development front, we have recently launched several new or improved endoscopy disposable product lines, which we expect will generate positive sales momentum as we progress through fiscal year 2014. We also remain very confident in the strength and capability of the entire Medivators United States direct sales and service team and their ability to effectively launch and grow our increasing product portfolio. 
 Further, we are in the process of adding a number of additional sales and marketing resources to this team to support growth towards the end of fiscal year 2014 and into fiscal year 2015. To lead this team, we have recently hired Michael Spicer as our new Senior Vice President of Endoscopy Sales and Service. Michael is a highly experienced senior sales executive with extensive U.S. hospital experience, including in the endoscopy market. He has held senior positions in sales with Smith &amp; Nephew and Boston Scientific. 
 On a further positive note, we are pleased to just announced on November 6, the acquisition of Jet Prep Ltd. based in Israel. This acquisition brings Medivators team another innovative single-use endoscopy product. The Jet Prep device, which has FDA 510-K and CE marked clearances, is a novel irrigation and aspiration catheter used to improve visualization during colonoscopy procedures. A small group of engineers in Israel will remain and work on new product development for the company. 
 As we look at fiscal year 2015 and beyond, we see the potential for significant growth in our Endoscopy segment in international markets for all product categories. This large opportunity is why we are now making major investments in sales and marketing and new product development that is focused specifically on international markets. And we will continue to make these investments throughout fiscal year 2014. 
 Additionally, this business could benefit greatly from further acquisitions. 
 Our Water Purification and Filtration segment has shown strong performance for the past 2 years. This quarter, sales grew by 20% over the same quarter last year. Sales for the quarter of $39.8 million were another record and up 11% sequentially. The increase was primarily due to record shipments of Water Purification equipment, as well as sales generated from our Siemens dialysis water acquisition. 
 Operating profit was nicely leveraged to 131% increase over the same quarter last year. The profit increase was driven primarily by the greater shipments. 
 During the first quarter, we continue to see broad marketing acceptance of our heat-based disinfection central and portable water purification systems. These automated systems provide for a higher standard of Water Purification than the older conventional technology equipment, they replaced and provide great benefits to our dialysis customers and their patients. Sales of these more advanced machines would sell for higher average selling prices now account for about 70% to 75% of our shipments. We expect the adoption rate for these newer and higher value technology platforms to grow further as customers continue to recognize the performance benefits and cost savings provided by these new products. 
 On a further positive note, Water Purification equipment orders greatly exceeded the very strong shipments, leading to another quarter end with a record backlog, which bodes well for continued growth over the next few quarters. 
 Adding to our optimism about the future of our Water Purification business is the integration of the acquired Siemens dialysis water business announced on March 25. By the end of the first quarter, we were mostly complete the transferring hundreds of new United States and Canadian customer service contracts to Mar Cor Purification. That will add approximately $10 million in ongoing new business in fiscal year 2014. We will now be able to better utilize our large service network and have another installed base of machines to target for upgrading to our new heat-based technologies. And not only can we now market our new technologies with ease, acquired install base, but also an overwhelming number of the 6,000 dialysis clinics in United States are still using older, manually, chemically disinfectant Water Purification equipment, which is an opportunity for Mar Cor in the future quarters. 
 As I discussed last quarter, our Mar Cor unit has taken over management of our $14 million Therapeutic Filtration and Chemistries businesses. We are now adding some sales marketing and product development resources to pursue what we believe will be profitable growth opportunities in these businesses going forward. Most of the potential benefits with these investments will start in fiscal year 2015. And we are optimistic that we have some exciting future opportunities with our unique hollow fiber filters, as well as our noble new REVOX sterilization service technology. 
 Overall, we remain very optimistic that we can continue the great momentum we have achieved over a number of quarters now in the Water Purification and Filtration business. 
 Our Crosstex Healthcare Disposables business continue to be a strong performer as well. First quarter sales of $26.2 million grew by 32% over the quarter, the same quarter last year, primarily driven by sales of SPS Medical products. Organic growth was roughly 4%. The acquisition of SPS in November 2012 greatly added to our sterility assurance product offering. We are very pleased that this business has performed to our high expectations. In the back 2013, we integrated the SPS Rochester New York operation into our current ERP system. We are also excited about the opportunities to leverage our combined SPS and Crosstex product lines outside the dental market into the physician office and hospital markets. 
 Operating profits for this segment grew by 40% this quarter, primarily due to incremental SPS Medical product sales, but also for some underlying operating leverage. We had improved gross margins due to sales of higher-margin products, such as face masks and the continued growth of our ConFirm line of sterility assurance products. 
 As we go forward, I remain optimistic about the growth of the Healthcare Disposables business, driven by our increasing presence in the sterility assurance market from new opportunities and hospitals and alternate care markets, for new product development activities and from potential international sales growth. We are making sales and marketing investments to grow the United States hospital and alternate channel markets -- to grow the United States hospitals and alternate channel markets, as well as our historically strong position in the dental market. 
 One of our big opportunities in this segment is the recent United States launch of RAPICIDE OPA-28, our third automated in endoscopy processing chemical and our first chemistry product that can address the large market for manual soaking of instruments. The effort is being led by the hospital distributor team with great assistance from our much larger endoscopy direct sales team. Early results are very promising and we are planning some international launches in upcoming quarters. 
 We're also making substantial investments to increase our Healthcare Disposables growth in international markets. We have recently hired a dedicated Healthcare Disposables focused sales executive in Asia and are now looking for additional resources in Europe. Further, our recently hired Crosstex Senior Vice President of Sales, Ken Plunkett has extensive experience in international markets. Ken most recently, held a senior sales position with, Hu-Friedy a leading company in the global dental industry. 
 In the Dialysis segment, as expected, first quarter sales were 11% lower, primarily due to a decline in reused equipment and chemicals in the United States. Operating profit decreased by 19%, but operating margin was still high at 24%. Relative to the growth in the rest of Cantel, this segment has become a much smaller part of our overall company, representing now only 8% of our combined segment operating profit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2014, as compared to 12% in the same quarter last year. Nonetheless, the business remains important to the company and we work hard to continue to take care of our customers while seeking growth globally. 
 So now I'll turn it over to our CFO, Craig Sheldon to take us through some financial details. 
 Craig A. Sheldon 
 Okay. Thank you, Andy, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to turn your attention to the earnings release issued earlier this morning. And as always, start by going down the income statement. 
 As Andy has already indicated, sales increased by 18.7% in the first quarter versus last year's first quarter to a record $118.3 million with organic growth, as Andy indicated of 10%. The top line growth was driven by all 3 of our largest segments: Endoscopy, Water Purification and Healthcare Disposables, partially offset by a decline in Dialysis. 
 There were 2 acquisitions that we've talked about before that impacted the numbers, I just wanted to go over those again. The first was the SPS Medical acquisition, that company as we have indicated, was acquired on November 1, 2012, that was the first day of last year's second fiscal quarter. Therefore, this acquisition is reflected only in our fiscal 2014 first quarter and not in the prior year's first quarter. SPS Medical contributed sales of $5.5 million in the first quarter this year reported in our Healthcare Disposable segment. 
 Second acquisition, we have talked about the Siemens Water, which although is closed in March, had a end of the fourth quarter closing date for accounting purposes, which is why the majority of the former Siemens' customers were transferred over to our Water business. This acquisition contributed sales of approximately $3 million in the first quarter and is not reflected in last year's first quarter. So between the [indiscernible] million of first quarter sales. 
 The gross profit in the first quarter was 43.5%. So approximately the same as last year's 43.3%. The new Medical Device Tax was $956,000 in the first quarter. Again, we've talked about that tax was effective on January 1, so we didn't have it in the first quarter of the prior year. So if you adjust for the Medical Device Tax, the gross margin in the first quarter would have been 44.4%, that's a 90 basis point improvement, which translates to about $1.50 per share. 
 So aside from the impact on the Medical Device Tax, our GP percentage actually were up quite nicely, primarily due to a favorable sales mix in all 3 of our largest segments. 
 Gross operating expenses increased by $5.4 million in the first quarter compared to last year's quarter, attributable principally to adding the SPS Medical infrastructure and I guess, a bit of the Siemens infrastructure, as well as continued investments in personnel, particularly in our sales teams, as well as other sales and marketing initiatives, all of which is an important part of our future of strategic growth plan. 
 Operating income overall reporting a $2.3 million increase over last year's quarter, which is 14.7%. And again, if you pulled out the effect of that Medical Device Tax, our operating earnings actually would have been up 21%. All 3 of our major segments contributed significantly to the strong earnings growth improvement, which was achieved while still allowing for us to continue the investments in our sales and marketing programs. 
 Our net interest is relatively unchanged over the first quarter last year. Although, we made substantial debt repayments in the past 12 months. That's been offset by additional borrowings for our new acquisitions. But total interest expense remains at only $644,000, so quite a low number. If we continue to repay borrowings quickly. We have strong cash flow and maintain very low interest rates. 
 On the income tax line, the overall effective rate was 36.7% in the first quarter, which is down from 37.6% in last year's first quarter. And as I've indicated in the past, the overall effective rate is very difficult to predict and is directly impacted by geographic mix and the timing and extent of new tax legislation. However, since 96% of our pretax income is generated in the U.S., assuming the legislative changes and tax rates or credits, this tax rate is expected to be right in this range roughly. I may would point out that the R&amp;E credit, who once again, is set to expire at the end of the calendar year, seems to be a recurring theme. That's very important to us and hopefully as far as any budget and tax resolutions, we'll get that R&amp;E credit reinstated. So we'll wait and see on that. 
 I also wanted to mention that in October, our Board of Directors approved a 22% increase in the semi-annual cash dividend to $0.045 per outstanding share of common stock, that's $0.09 on an annual basis and that will be paid in January. 
 And finally, the income statement, as previously reported in July, we completed a 3 point -- 3-for-2 stock split last July. Therefore, all EPS and all share amounts reported in the earnings release, as well as the upcoming 10-Q that relate to the prior year have been restated to reflect the effect of the stock split. 
 Moving onto the balance sheet, remains very strong. We had $28.5 million in cash and cash equivalents at the end of October, $91.3 million of working capital and a current ratio of 2.5:1. 
 Our funded debt was $82 million at October 31. And meanwhile, we continue to pay down significant levels of debt. In fact, we paid down $13 million of debt during the first quarter and this is the most we've ever paid down in any single quarter. 
 Our net debt is $53.5 million at October 31. This is a reduction of $7.4 million compared to the end of last July. Gross debt to equity is only 0.25 at October 31. And our gross debt to rolling 12-month EBITDAS is now under 1 or 0.94. 
 And we generated $24.1 million of EBITDAS in the first quarter. This is 15% higher than the prior year's first quarter. Rolling 12-month EBITDAS continues to grow and is now $87.5 million. Cash flow provided by operations was $10.8 million in the first quarter. That's a strong number for us in the first quarter. Capital expenditures were $2.2 million in the first quarter. So we continue to demonstrate strong cash generation capabilities and the ability to pay down meaningful portions of debt every quarter. 
 And finally, just to alert everyone, we will be filing our 10-Q next Tuesday on its normal deadline. 
 So at this point, Andy, I'd like to turn the call back over to you for some closing comments. 
 Andrew A. Krakauer 
 Okay. Great, thanks, Craig. So, look, in summary, the first quarter was an outstanding start of fiscal year 2014 for Cantel Medical. We continued the momentum of our strong fiscal year 2013 and achieved new sales and earnings records. And this quarter exemplifies why we're so optimistic about the future of Cantel. We showed excellent sales growth of 19% and if not for the Medical Device Tax, would have leveraged the sales increase to a 23% increase in net income. 
 Also, this quarter was the second consecutive quarter that we had 10% organic sales growth, which obviously is very important. We continue to demonstrate consistent growth through execution of our three-pronged strategy, investments in new product development, increased sales and marketing activities and a proven acquisition program. And despite the significant investments in future growth drivers, we improved operating profits by driving sales growth, while focusing on increasing gross margins, accelerating the growth of the businesses we acquire and driving overall operating leverage as a result of increased volumes and careful expense management. 
 More importantly, all of our major businesses have great growth prospects. And now in addition of SPS Medical and the Siemens Dialysis water business, we had added additional important contributors to growth, which has positively affected this quarter and will as we go forward. 
 Additionally, our customers in the Dialysis industry just received good news, which, of course, is good news for us, as they proposed 9% cut in reimbursement for Dialysis treatments have been postponed at least until 2015 and will be reviewed again in 2015. This was good news just received a few days ago. The worldwide market potential for our products continues to grow and has never been greater. As we discussed last quarter, our strategic plan supports our aspirations to double sale and profits in the next 5 years. These are aspirations and not predictions. But we are optimistic that we can achieve these goals. Our detailed market analysis have shown that we now compete in total addressable markets well in excess of $5 million with great opportunities for growth in all of our major businesses. This potential and our clear growth drivers are reasons why we believe that Cantel has never been better positioned for meaningful sustainable growth over the medium to long-term horizon. We are focusing on substantial sales and marketing investments to promote newly launched products, to meaningfully grow international sales and increase penetration in our existing markets. We are investing in future new products; Disposables, Chemistries and Equipment, which we believe have large potential upside 2 or 3 years from now. We should expect to see continue to invest heavily in these categories with acceleration and expenditures over the next few quarters, as these investments are required to build the foundation to enable Cantel to achieve our medium and long-term strategic growth objectives. 
 Let me just expand briefly on our planned investments for 2014. Our great success in the past 5 years have come from substantial investments again in sales and marketing and R&amp;D. And these investments are based on well defined strategic objectives and identification of very specific opportunities. And we have identified these are large opportunities for further sales growth by adding new products, especially broadening the product portfolio in the Endoscopy business. And we have a goal to greatly accelerate the growth of all these products in international markets. Some of these international strategy includes going to direct in certain countries and generally increasing focused sales and marketing support in major markets. 
 I also mentioned that we are adding physicians to strengthen our Healthcare Disposables and Water Purification businesses as well. These strategies have great potential in the medium and long-term but call for substantial upfront investments. To achieve the objectives of our 5-year strategic plan, we have added a number of sales and marketing positions already in fiscal year 2013 and has a detailed plan for recruiting new physicians over the next few quarters. Again, not only are we adding to our sales and marketing teams, but we're also adding needed infrastructure and support roles, just one example being finance and HR teams in China, as well in other locations, as for example, Singapore. 
 In the first quarter, we added about 20 positions and have plan to add up between 30 and 40 more over the rest of fiscal year 2014. The majority of these positions, again, but not all are in sales and marketing. And about 40% are dedicated to international markets. 
 Despite these investments in the business, we expect to grow annual earnings this year. Besides increase profits driven by the sales growth, we are implementing cost and operating expense efficiency programs to in part help pay for these incremental investments. The benefits of these cost reductions plan will begin in the second half of fiscal year 2014. 
 We feel confident in our growth plans and see great opportunities in all of our major businesses to grow organically. But we also continue our success in identifying, executing and integrating acquisitions worldwide. This is a core competency of Cantel that has brought us top-notch entrepreneurial management, new and higher-margin products and additional growth in sales and profits on our improvement strategy to invest and accelerate the growth of the acquired companies. 
 We continue to search and identification of synergistic markets and potential acquisition targets is a key role of our senior management team. And in particular, we have increased our focus on international targets. This worth noting that international acquisitions carry substantial greater transaction costs for travel, legal translations transaction services and acquisitions in the United States. And we're dealing with those expenses right now. We expect to have an excellent fiscal year 2014, which will be a year of major investments to accelerate future growth worldwide and we're off to a great start. 
 Our second quarter will have a few less selling days than our first quarter and with almost 75% of our sales been recurring, this may affect financial performance relative to the first quarter that we just completed. Nonetheless, we have great momentum, leading positions in a growing multibillion-dollar global infection prevention and control market and we have exciting opportunities before us with new products and expanding markets. 
 We are committed to profitably growing the company, while serving our customers and benefiting our shareholders. And again, our entire organization takes great pride in our mission to provide products, services and guidance to mitigate infection risks, improve safety and patient outcomes ultimately save lives. I thank all of our now over 1,300 loyal and hardworking employees for their great efforts and achievements in the first quarter of fiscal year 2014. 
 So thank you for listening. We look forward again, to speaking to you on our second quarter fiscal year 2014 earnings call in early March. And with that, Stacy, I'll turn it over to you, take some questions.

 Now I'd like to turn the call over to Eric Kirchner. Eric? 
 Eric W. Kirchner 
 Thank you, Rick. Good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 3. A strong October performance led to us to achieve our best quarterly results of fiscal 2014. Robust freight forwarding volumes and improved contract logistics and distribution activity generated our strongest revenue since the third quarter of last year. Increases from existing clients and some new business wins helped produce volume growth in the abbreviated peak season. 
 Several factors partially offset the volume growth in the quarter. Pricing continued to be under pressure, and we experienced some declines from other existing contracts. The effects of currency translation also lowered revenue and net revenue. 
 We continue to make significant progress on our system's deployment. It's exciting to report that our freight forwarding operating system went live in 5 additional countries since our last investor call, including Germany, which is our second largest market by shipments. We're live in 27 countries, representing approximately 50% of our freight forwarding volume. We've also completed the implementation of Oracle Financials for freight forwarding operations in 30 countries. Now please turn to Slide 4. 
 Freight forwarding revenues grew in the third quarter of fiscal 2014, primarily due to increases in airfreight tonnage and Ocean Freight TEUs. The Asia Pacific region led our growth. Net revenue per kilo and TEU were lower in the third quarter, both on a year-over-year and sequential basis, resulting from the pricing environment. 
 We continue to experience pressure on our sell rates, while buy rates were volatile throughout the quarter. Contract logistics and distribution delivered their best quarterly results of the year. Adjusted operating income nearly doubled from the second quarter of fiscal 2014 through the third quarter, and the margin percentage was up approximately 40 basis points year-over-year. 
 We saw increased activity from new business wins and good expense management in the Americas, higher activity in our Africa distribution businesses and improvement in our European and Asia Pacific contract logistics businesses. 
 Turning to Slide 5. Expenses remain inflated due to the ongoing investment in our transformation. We incurred approximately $4 million of implementation and duplicative costs related to the rollout of our new freight forwarding system during the third quarter, and we began amortizing previously capitalized expenses in September. However, because of the progress we've made in our system deployment, we've begun to remove costs from the organization. We removed approximately $30 million in pretax operating expenses on an annualized basis at the end of the third quarter. None of these cost reductions are reflected in our third quarter results. 
 We anticipate an additional $10 million to $12 million of annualized pretax operating expenses to be removed by the end of our 2014 fiscal year. The remainder of our cost actions and efficiency improvements are expected to be substantially complete by the end of fiscal 2015. These actions position us well to achieve our $75 million to $95 million cumulative pretax annualized savings target. 
 Please turn to Slide 6. The purpose of this slide is to clarify our targets for the next 2 quarters and the run rate at the end of our next fiscal year. We thought it important to get focused on our go-forward actions. In this slide, we provide estimates on the phasing of these reductions by quarter through our first quarter of fiscal year 2015 and where we believe we'll be at the end of next year. 
 We've also included the impact of costs associated with the amortization of the new system. By the end of the year, we expect to have in place approximately $85 million in annualized pretax cost savings, which will be offset by approximately $23 million in amortization expense. 
 Now I ask Rick to cover our financial results in greater detail. Rick? 
 Richard G. Rodick 
 Thanks, Eric. Please turn to Slide 7. On a GAAP basis, we reported a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $0.09 per diluted share in the fiscal 2014 third quarter. Excluding adjustments to GAAP results, which I'll discuss in a moment, we reported adjusted net income of $8 million, or $0.08 per diluted share. This compares to adjusted net income of $0.16 per diluted share recorded in the same period last year. 
 Currency changes continue to have a negative impact on our third quarter results. U.S. dollar was stronger against most currencies, particularly the South African rand. Reported revenues and expenses in the third quarter were negatively impacted by approximately 3 to 4 percentage points. Currency translation also had a negative effect of about 8 percentage points on operating income. 
 Revenue and net revenue decreased 0.2% and 2.5%, respectively, in the third quarter compared to the same period last year. The decrease in revenue reflects the impact of currency, lower pricing and reduced activity in contract logistics. These factors are partially offset by higher volumes in freight forwarding and broad-based improvement in distribution. 
 On an organic basis, revenue increased 3.1%, while net revenue rose 1.6% compared to the same period last year. Third quarter adjustments to GAAP results included severance costs of $13 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 and $4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2013. 
 Severance costs were primarily related to transformation activity. In addition, we incurred $5 million in last year's third quarter for legal judgment relating to a 2006 warehouse fire. We also increased our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets by approximately $3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2014. 
 As stated previously, this is pursuant to the accounting rules related to income taxes and does not affect our ability to utilize the operating loss carryforwards once these operations become profitable. We have provided reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP results in the tables in today's press release and posted more details on our website. The rest of my remarks will refer to our results, as adjusted, to exclude the impact of severance and the valuation allowances. 
 Adjusted operating expenses in the third quarter were higher than the same period last year. On an organic basis, adjusted operating expenses increased 4.2%, primarily due to the transformation costs. These costs included approximately $4 million in implementation and duplicative costs during the quarter. 
 In September, we began amortizing the previously capitalized costs associated with the new system, and we expect this system amortization to be approximately $23 million annually. Our adjusted operating income of $20 million in the third quarter compares to $32 million in the same period last year. The decrease was primarily due to higher operating expenses and currency translation. The increased operating expenses were directly related to transformation costs. 
 Now please turn to Slide 8. Revenues from freight forwarding segment were up 1.6%, primarily due to higher volumes, partially offset by reduced pricing and the impact of currency. Ocean Freight TEUs increased 10.7% in the quarter compared with the prior year, and airfreight tonnage was up 8.8%. Net revenues in freight forwarding increased 1.1% in the third quarter due to higher volumes and lower buying rates. 
 Net revenue per kilo declined 8%, while net revenue per TEU fell 4% in the third quarter compared to the same period last year. Adjusted operating profit in freight forwarding declined 24% in the third quarter compared to the same period last year, primarily due to higher operating expenses and currency translation. The increased operating expenses in freight forwarding, as I've said before, reflect investments in our transformation. 
 Please turn to Slide 9. Contract logistics and distribution revenues and net revenues decreased 3.8% and 5.5% in the third quarter, respectively, compared to the same period last year. The declines were primarily due to the impact of currency and changes in our portfolio. This was partially offset by increased activity in our distribution's operations. 
 We did a good job managing cost in our contract logistics and distribution segments. Adjusted operating expenses in the segment were down 5.9% compared to last year's third quarter. As a result, operating profit in contract logistics and distribution was essentially flat on a year-over-year basis. 
 On an organic basis, adjusted operating profits rose 6% on a year-over-year basis, our first increase in a year. Cash flow from operations was an outflow of $68 million in the first 9 months of fiscal 2014, compared to last year's outflow of $57 million. Working capital decreased $143 million compared to a decline of $160 million in the first 9 months of last year. In the fiscal 2014 third quarter, working capital decreased $62 million compared to a decline of $70 million in the same period last year. Our fourth quarter is historically our strongest free cash flow quarter, and I anticipate improvement in the cash collections in the fourth quarter. 
 With that, I'll turn the call back to Eric for his closing remarks. Eric? 
 Eric W. Kirchner 
 Thanks, Rick. Please turn to Slide 10. The macroeconomic and freight environments will continue to be challenging, which underscores the importance of completing our system deployment as soon as possible. Pricing continues to be under pressure, and we expect this to be the case for the foreseeable future. 
 So far, the peak season is playing out as we predicted on our last call. The past season tightened certain key markets, leading to significant increases in airfreight buy rates in recent weeks. Like many of our peers, we recovered a portion of these higher rates through pricing adjustments, but we still expect to see some yield compression in the fourth quarter. 
 Also, many ocean carriers continue to push for higher rates. Their success depends primarily on capacity adjustments, further complicating the unstable nature of the pricing environments. We're very pleased with the progress made under our transformation initiatives. 
 As I said earlier, we've launched our OneView system in 27 countries, representing about 50% of shipments, including the U.S. and Germany, which are our 2 largest markets. These are major milestones in our comprehensive business process transformation, and it's notable that the U.S. represented the largest and most complex deployment challenge of our entire project. 
 We have more work ahead of us, but we've already developed a major functionality that's necessary to install the system in all the remaining countries. The sequencing to complete the rollout is paced to accommodate linkages to global customs brokerage systems and the capacity of our deployment teams. We continue to expect approximately 70% of shipments to be on this system at the end of this fiscal year, and to complete the deployment by the middle of fiscal year 2015. 
 Before I turn the call back over to Rick to direct the Q&amp;A period, I'd like to thank all of our UTi Worldwide employees, who continue to work hard to deliver on our transformation goals. We still have much to do, but I'm very proud of the progress that our team has made. With that, back to Rick. Thank you. 
 Richard G. Rodick 
 Thanks, Eric. [Operator Instructions] Operator, may we have the first question, please?

CTSH," 
   Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (CTSH) 2013 Crédit Suisse Annual Tech Conference Transcript December  5, 2013 11:00 AM ET 
 George Mihalos - Crédit Suisse 
 Okay. So, I think, we are ready to begin. Thank you for joining us this morning. My name is George Mihalos. I cover the Data Processing and IT Services space here at Crédit Suisse. We are very, very pleased to welcome back Cognizant to our conference this year. And upon on the stage with me is CFO, Karen McLoughlin. I do want to point out that David Nelson is sitting in the audience there as well. Thank you for being here again this year. 
 Now in prior conferences like spend 10 minutes just going over the management compensation, okay, but you took it away from this year. So now I actually have to work for leaving for a little bit. 
 So why don’t we start off with the demand environment, you had a very, very strong 2013, slated for more than 20% topline growth? You spoke much more optimistically about discretionary spending now as a sort of existing the year? Maybe you can give us a little bit of color on what you are seeing globally geographically and also maybe the one or two sectors that are performing ahead of your expectations based on what you are seeing? 
 Karen McLoughlin 
 Sure. Thanks, George, and thank you for having us. 2013 really has turned out to be a very nice year. We saw this really at the end of Q1 going into Q2 where we did see a pick in discretionary spending with our clients. And if I talk about the pieces of the business and what we are seeing as I -- as a year has moved forward, really came from a number of areas. 
 If you go back into the middle of 2012, we really start to see a pick up in financial services and that trend has continued into this year. And in financial services what you are seeing is clients really looking to continue to optimize their cost structure but also needing to start to spend money on some of the regulatory work that they need to get done, also seeing a lot of work with clients around mobile solutions and financial services, and then also around analytics. So how can they use the data, they have more effectively to understand their customer base and what’s happening in their business. 
 In -- so that’s a very strong area of growth for us throughout this year. As we moved into Q2 and certainly into Q3 then, well, another area of strong growth really came from our healthcare practice. 
 And if folks remember back in 2012, in the middle of the year, we start to see a little bit of slowdown in healthcare after the Affordable Care Act was put into place, clients pull a little bit, trying to understand what the impact of the Act could be on their business and really took some time to work through that. 
 And then as regard into the middle of 2013, obviously clients understood what they needed to do support the Act that the timeframe that we are seeing in place and we saw a big pick up in spending from our clients as they look to be able to implement their pieces of the Affordable Care Act. 
 That’s very interesting work, because obviously, there is a, what we think a long tail of work that has to happen to support the Affordable Care Act. If you think about historically our business has been primarily on the payer side of the business and so our payer clients are having to interface with all of the exchanges as they come online with the various states, as well as the federal exchange, but also the states themselves are having to put in place their exchange programs and in the first wave only a handful of states that actually implemented exchanges over the next two years or so, we would look to see the rest of the states implement their state exchanges. So a lot of very interesting work going on in healthcare from that perspective. 
 So those are really the two biggest drivers of growth in terms of this year, but certainly the entire business of four mandatory segments have had very good growth throughout the year. From a geographic perspective, growth has been very balanced across our three major geographies across North America, Europe and what we call the rest of world, which is Asia and the Middle East. 
 But in particular, I want to focus on kind of Europe a little bit. So back at the end of Q1, we talked about an acquisition we had done in Germany, the C1 Group. We started to see some very nice traction there, but even our core kind of Europe business has really tried to see a nice pickup this year and starting to see some very good growth in Europe, very strong pipeline. Our clients in Europe are really looking at how do they significantly transformed their business, change their operating model, really drive down their cost of ownership, so that they can continue to be successful in a global environment. 
 And we’ve talked about this notion for a few years that we thought kind of Europe had the potential to be as big as North American and then it really is a matter of time as to when that pipeline would start to kick in the place and certainly that’s what we are starting to see now, so we are very positive on Europe. 
 George Mihalos - Crédit Suisse 
 
 So maybe, we will just take a minute there to govern Europe a little bit. Ex-acquisitions is a big part of the growth coming from your existing customers ramping spending with your or is it more new customer acquisitions? 
 Karen McLoughlin 
 In Europe, it’s actually got a very good balance of both. So we have seen a lot of new local activity in Europe. Typically in our business give or take 90% to 95% of our revenue in Europe comes from existing client as of January 1st of that year. But I would say in kind of Europe, just because of the significant growth we are seeing. And the brand recognition that we now have in Europe, we are seeing a much higher ratio were coming from new locals as we continue to penetrate the European market and we would expect that to continue for some time. 
 George Mihalos - Crédit Suisse 
 Correct. Great. And you also made some other positive comments on the three console regarding client budgets for next year. Looks like we may actually see an uptick for the first time in several years, maybe you can talk a little bit about your confidence in making that whole analysis you still going through the budget process? 
 Karen McLoughlin 
 Yeah. So, I think what we’ve said in our calls is that we would expect client budgets to be flat to slightly up and I think that will be industry specific and client specific. We are still finalizing budget process both internally and with our clients. But I think generally that sentiment holds true at this point. I think that's consistent with what others are hearing in the industry. 
 We always view that as a positive thing for us. The clients are really looking for these days is partners who can come in and help somewhat, what we call the dual mandates, so help me run better, help me drive cost efficiency and effectiveness into my business and also help me transform and innovate my business. 
 And so partners like Cognizant who can bring really that integrated set of solution offerings to clients bring that consulting capability to client are really what clients are looking for these days. And even if the client’s budget is flat that plays well because you can drive down their cost and they are still hoping their investment dollars to innovate. 
 George Mihalos - Crédit Suisse 
 So I think this year -- or last year when you spoke about going into a flattish budget environment for 2013, you still manage to do extraordinarily well. I think it’s 19% organic growth that you’ve been able to post now. Not looking for guidance but kind of thinking 2014 and beyond obviously, I would assume there is nothing you’re seeing that would cause your growth to decelerate in an environment where budgets will grow? 
 Karen McLoughlin 
 I mean, certainly we haven’t provided guidance there for next year but I think this trend again that I talked about of client’s looking for partners who can help them be more innovative, who can help them transform their business, bring this integrated set of solution offerings, bring me my consulting, bring me my BPO, my infrastructure and my IT solutions, really help me transform my business for the long term, it’s really what clients are looking for. 
 And given the main expertise that we have in the industries in which we serve and a very strong client relationships we’ve had historically, that tends to fare very well for us in terms of our ability to help our clients move forward. 
 George Mihalos - Crédit Suisse 
 So Cognizant and a handful of other tier 1 providers have been beneficiaries of vendor consolidation for many years now. Just wondering if you are seeing anything different than the competitive landscape, if maybe you are seeing some non-traditional players perhaps moving up a little bit in the stack and the capabilities that they can provide? 
 Karen McLoughlin 
 So I think you are right. I think vendor consolidation does continue that tends to be -- industries go through it in different cycles but we continue to see vendor consolidation. Again, it comes back to clients looking for partners, who they want a strong relationship with. They want people who can bring thought leadership. They want people who they know will stick with them, to help them solve their problems and that typically has been a very good opportunity for Cognizant and we continue to see that. 
 I certainly wouldn’t say that in the larger relationships that we’re seeing new competitors on the market, I think different parts of our business has some niche competitors. So some of our BPO work that we do that is very specialized to certain industries or certain types of processes you would have since smaller, more focused competitors in that space. That is the general rule of thumb, I think our competitors’ peer group is fairly whole. 
 George Mihalos - Crédit Suisse 
 Okay. Another part of that is we’ve been hearing more and more about these large transformational dealers that have been out there for several years, again probably more prolifically for last two years. Can you talk a little bit about why you think Cognizant has been able to outgrow its competitors? Other providers would also have these capabilities which we don’t seem to be putting up the growth rate that you have been able to continue? 
 Karen McLoughlin 
 I think a lot of it really comes down to, again, it’s about relationship, because when you are asking clients or when the clients asking for a partner to go on a transformational journey with them, there isn’t necessarily a one-side, that’s our solution. And these tend to be very customized solutions. You really need a lot of thought leadership as to how you are going to help the customer on that transformation journey and spend a lot of time partnering with them on that. 
 So, it really comes down to that customer relationship. It comes down to having the consulting front-end. So over the last five or six years we have put a lot of investment into our consulting practice, really making sure that we have build out that capability that we have folks who can really sit down at the table with the customer and really help them to think through a problem. And it’s not just an IT problem, right, it’s a business problem. 
 So, can you help bring me the right folks to the table who can work not just with the CIO organization but it might be with the operation’s team, with the finance organization, with the marketing organization and really get outside of just core IT and help me solve the business problem and make sure that you are bringing me the right solution. 
 And I think that there are only a handful of vendors and partners like ourselves who have really focused on building out that capability and I think that’s really a lot of what’s giving us the edge right now. 
 George Mihalos - Crédit Suisse 
 It’s good to hear. And maybe on that point again, you talked extensively about SMAC stack and your capabilities there? I think you put out a target of $500 million in revenue for ’13 coming from SMAC. How are you tracking compared to that? Does that feel conservative to you now given the traction that you have seen in the marketplace? 
 Karen McLoughlin 
 Sure. We are seeing great traction out of our SMAC stack for social, mobile, analytics and cloud. And as you mentioned earlier in the year, we talked about that that business was on track to do $500 million this year and we are still on track to do that. 
 I think what’s been interesting for us is the growth has been frankly a little faster than we expected it to be at this point. Certainly, over the next three to five years we would expect our Horizon 3 business as to become a meaningful part of revenue and to become a meaningful part of our growth story as we look out five years and beyond, and we are certainly on track to do that. 
 We are getting very good reception in the marketplace to some of the solutions that we build for certain industries and for our clients, and being able to take those solutions to market now. And that we are very, very excited about the progress we are making there. 
 George Mihalos - Crédit Suisse 
 
 Great. And maybe related to that, one of the concerns we hear from investors was obviously that as business model shift more cloud, more SaaS implementations that there is a risk of vendor disintermediation, lower maintenance revenue? How do you respond to those concerns and you see SMAC is more an opportunity or long-term threat? 
 Karen McLoughlin 
 
 Sure. I think for us SMAC is an opportunity and partially that's because of our history and where we came from. So, if you think about our client base today, these are large you know Fortune 1000, Global 2000 companies, so very, very complicated large operating platforms. 
 And so what we are seeing with our client base today is they are not able to move their big enterprise platforms to the clouds and that’s not really part of the conversation but what is part of the conversation is how do they create an environment where they can be more nimble, have apps that can -- peripheral apps, maybe they can go on the cloud, be more flexible, give them more agility, more nimbleness to move forward and to support their business. That actually plays very well into our sweet spot because we can help them build out that capability. 
 Over the long term, maybe some of the applications maintenance longer term get reduced for the core app maybe, but we think what will happen is in fact those dollars will get redeployed into new innovation, new transformation projects and that clearly has typically been a good thing for us. 
 George Mihalos - Crédit Suisse 
 
 So the trick is to win more valid share? 
 Karen McLoughlin 
 
 Win more valid share, absolutely. 
 George Mihalos - Crédit Suisse 
 
 That’s great. And maybe just kind of shifting gears a little bit more specifically to some of the verticals. You’ve managed to build the financial services vertical ahead of overall company growth, which is really impressive given it’s 40% plus of revenue, just wanted to talk a little bit about the drivers of that business, maybe how much of that is really driven by regulatory investment versus more discretionary things? 
 Karen McLoughlin 
 The thing about our financial services businesses is really two components, so it’s the banking side of the business as well as the insurance side of the business. And I think really what you are seeing is over the last couple of years, our addressable market within a client has actually doubled in size. So as we have expanded our service offerings as we have matured our product and our business that has given us the capability to branch into lots of other areas within our financial services and other clients. And I think that’s a lot of what you are seeing today. 
 So, if you go back five or six years ago, our BPO and our infrastructure and our consulting businesses were nascent businesses. Today that’s 20% of our total revenue and so a lot of it is really around service expansion both in banking and in the insurance practice. 
 In banking, you are seeing some regulatory work but that is just a piece of the growth story that we are seeing. A lot of it is around additional service offerings, some of the transformation work and some of the work that we are doing around the NASDAQ. So it’s a very nice, I would say, a broad range of service offerings and global expansion as well. 
 George Mihalos - Crédit Suisse 
 That’s great. And maybe just to ask one more regulatory question. Are you getting more of a push from Dodd-Frank or Basel III implementations or are they one and the same essentially? 
 Karen McLoughlin 
 So that is some of the work that we are doing for our financial services clients. Regulatory work has always been a big part of our work with our clients because we have such a strong demand expertise, so when there is regulatory work going on we tend to get certainly our fair share of that work. 
 George Mihalos - Crédit Suisse 
 But is that not one more than the other based on your…? 
 Karen McLoughlin 
 No. It is very client specific so. 
 George Mihalos - Crédit Suisse 
 Okay. That’s helpful. And focusing a little bit on the healthcare business, obviously that had a beautiful start in the third quarter, was nice to see that come back. Can you quantify or give us a sense, how much of the revenue acceleration was really the target of Affordable Care Act? 
 Karen McLoughlin  
 So, I mean a lot of the acceleration that we saw in Q3 was really, did in some form or another say, Affordable Care Act. What you saw was not just IT work so, a lot of it is also BPO work, so trying to actually get people on board and on to the programs. Our customers are looking at how do they manage all these new members that they will be getting as a result of this. Obviously, you are seeing a very nice combination of BPO as well as IT and then the interesting thing around the Affordable Care Act is that the next couple of years is just a lot of working that has to do just to implement the program and get the program up and running. 
 But our hypothesis is that once soon as the basics of the program are up and running, really the next phase of this is really clients looking at how do you really change healthcare delivery in United States, and how do you really drive down the cost of healthcare that can continue to deliver great healthcare quality in the United States. And so the lot of work the clients are trying to think about around that, a lot of consulting opportunity obviously that comes with that as we try to help clients think about what the future of healthcare really looks like. 
 George Mihalos - Crédit Suisse 
 So it certainly sounds like the push out of some of these important mandates has not had any impact on your business there? 
 Karen McLoughlin 
 Not at this point, no. 
 George Mihalos - Crédit Suisse 
 Okay. Okay. And you talked about the pharma business a year ago being weaker and the healthcare business underperformed for the last four quarters relative to the rest of the business. Has pharma bottomed now and maybe you can talk a little bit about how you think about it in 2014 based on the clinical pipeline that are out there? 
 Karen McLoughlin 
 So, life sciences, certainly is growing slower than the company averaged this year, but it is growing double digits. So it is certainly not that we have seen a pullback or a shrinkage in our life sciences practice. It is just relative to the rest of the company. I think at this point I think it is early to say what happens in ’14, although I think certainly I would at this point I am not expecting in the beginning of the year that there will be any sudden turnaround in the life sciences. 
 I think formers clients are also undergoing a lot of transition and turmoil in their business. I think it will be dependent upon how their pipeline recovers, whether that’s later next year or into 2015. But certainly at this point as I said, it is growing double digit, they are growing slower than the company average and in the short-term I would expect that to continue. 
 George Mihalos - Crédit Suisse 
 Why don’t we pause for a moment to see if there are any questions in the audience?

 Richard W. Dreiling 
 Thank you, Mary Winn. Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. Today, we plan to discuss the results of our third quarter, update you on our operating initiatives and share our store growth targets for 2014. 
 Our third quarter sales increased 10.5% over last year to $4.4 billion, with comp store sales up 4.4%. Both traffic and average ticket increased for the 23rd consecutive quarter, with customer traffic contributing most significantly to our sales increase. As we expected, the addition of tobacco products resulted in strong customer traffic growth throughout the quarter. 
 Consumables, which include tobacco and perishables, showed the strongest sales gains. For the second quarter in a row, we had comp sales growth on the non-consumable side of the business. Comp sales in both seasonal and home are positive, and we were pleased with our apparel performance. As part of our Phase 5 merchandising initiative to optimize square footage productivity, we reduced the selling space allocated to hanging apparel in over 4,000 stores. And in the third quarter -- excuse me, in the third quarter, and the results for meeting our expectations for both sales, and more importantly, increased profitability. 
 October Nielsen data indicates that we continue to increase our market share of consumables in units and dollars over the 4-week, 12-week, 24-week and 52-week periods. Our market share in dollars continues to grow in the high-single digits. 
 The third quarter operating profit increased by 8% to $390 million or 8.9% of sales. Our gross profit rate decreased 61 basis points to 30.3% of sales, with the vast majority of the rate compression relating to strong sales of tobacco and refrigerated items. In addition, we leveraged SG&amp;A expenses by 40 basis points as we continued our focus on expense control. Adjusted net income increased 10%, and adjusted earnings per share increased 14% to $0.72. 
 We're pleased to announce that we continued to return cash to our shareholders with an additional $200 million of share repurchases in the third quarter, and we increased our share repurchase authorization by another $1 billion, our single largest authorization to date. 
 Total inventories, including tobacco, which is incremental year-over-year, were up 11%, and on a per-store basis, were up 4%. We are pleased that we have begun to get our inventory growth back in line with sales growth. This is our lowest inventory growth rate since the 2012 second quarter. 
 In October, we've reached another major milestone. The grand opening of our 11,000th store here in Middle Tennessee. Our third quarter results were solid in spite of an aggressive competitive environment. Starting late in the second half of the quarter, we saw increases in the competitive share of boys in both print and electronic media. As has been reported over the last week, item and price intensity increased across all channels. 
 Before I'd turn the call over to David, I'd like to take the opportunity to congratulate Todd Vasos on his recent promotion to Chief Operating Officer, assuming the responsibility for store operations, merchandising and the supply chain. This is a very conventional alignment that I believe will strengthen the company and position us as well for future growth. 
 Since 2007, Dollar General has added almost 3,000 stores and nearly doubled in sales. I'm very proud of what we have accomplished and Todd has played a critical role in this amazing growth story. 
 I'd also like to welcome Dave D'Arezzo, as EVP and Chief Merchandising Officer. Dave joined the Dollar General team in early November, and brings more than 30 years of retail and consumer product experience across merchandising and operations. I work very closely with Dave at Duane Reade before I joined Dollar General in 2008, and I'm confident he's a great fit for the Dollar General team. 
 I will take -- I will talk more about our operating initiatives in a moment, but now I would like to turn the call over to David. 
 David M. Tehle 
 Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Rick covered the highlights of our third quarter sales performance, so starting with gross profit, I'll share more of the details. 
 Our gross profit increased 8.3% for the quarter. As a percentage of sales, gross profit decreased by 61 basis points to 30.3%. As expected, the gross margin rate was impacted by a higher mix of tobacco and perishables, which have lower initial markups. 
 In addition, our inventory shrinkage rate was higher than last year and we incurred higher markdowns as expected. The margin compression was partially offset by a benefit from transportation efficiencies and lower fuel cost, as well as a favorable LIFO credit. 
 SG&amp;A increased 8.5%, significantly lower than our sales increase. On an average per square footage basis, SG&amp;A increased about 1%. As a percentage of sales, SG&amp;A for the quarter was 21.4%, an improvement of 40 basis points. Contributing to this favorability was retail labor expense, which increased at a rate lower than sales. In addition, decreases in incentive compensation expense help benefit costs and workers' compensation and general liability expenses, contributed to our SG&amp;A leverage. 
 Costs that increased at a higher rate than the increase in sales include depreciation and amortization and fees associated with the increased use of debit cards. Interest expense for the quarter was $21.5 million, a decrease of $6.2 million, primarily due to lower rates resulting from the completion of our refinancing earlier this year. 
 Our ratio of adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA remains unchanged at 3.0. The third quarter effective tax rate was 35.6%, and includes a discrete tax benefit of approximately $6 million or $0.02 per share, relating to the reversal reserves that were established in 2009. This reversal was associated with the expiration of the time period in which additional taxes could've been assessed. 
 GAAP basis net income increased 14% to $237 million in the 2013 quarter from $208 million in the 2012 quarter. And earnings per share increased 19% to $0.74 from $0.62 last year. Adjusted to exclude the discrete tax benefit in 2013 and certain items in 2012, net income increased 10.5% to $231 million and earnings per share increased 14% to $0.72. Year-to-date, we generated cash from operations of $761 million, a 10% increase over the 2012 period. 
 Capital expenditures totaled $444 million, including $167 million for upgrades, remodels and relocations of existing stores; $103 million related to new leased stores; $86 million for distribution and transportation; $65 million for stores we purchased to build; and $17 million for information systems upgrade. Year-to-date, we've open 577 new stores, and relocated or remodeled 534 stores. We continue to be pleased with the performance of our new, relocated and remodeled stores, confirming our confidence in the relevance of our business model. 
 As Rick mentioned, we repurchased an additional $200 million of our common stock in the third quarter. Year-to-date, we have repurchased $420 million or 7.8 million shares, with approximately $224 million remaining under the existing authorization. 
 This week, our board approved an additional $1 billion for share repurchases. Since the inception of the share repurchase program in December 2011, we have repurchased 27.1 million shares, with a total cash outlay of approximately $1.3 billion and we plan to remain consistent, as well as opportunistic in share purchases going forward. 
 In November, we signed an agreement to sell and lease back 233 of our own stores. This transaction is expected to close in January, and result net proceeds to us in excess of $200 million, which we expect to utilize to fund incremental share repurchases in 2014. 
 Now let's look at our outlook for the remainder of the year, which is basically in line with our existing guidance, but refined with only one quarter to go. We expect total sales for the full year to increase 10% to 10.5%. Full year same-store sales are expected to increase 4% to 4.5%. 
 As a reminder, there are 6 fewer selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas, which will likely impact our sales. We're also cautious with regard to the competitive environment and our customers' ability to spend on discretionary items for the holidays, as many continue to face tough economic challenges and uncertainties about the future. 
 Operating profit, excluding the items identified in our press release, is expected to be in the range of $1.745 billion to $1.770 billion for the full year, raising the low-end and maintaining the high-end of our previous guidance. Interest expense is forecasted to be approximately $90 million. 
 The full year 2013 effective tax rate, excluding the $6 million discreet third quarter benefit, is expected to be between 37.5% and 38%. Adjusted earnings per share for the year are expected to be in the range of $3.18 to $3.22, which is a $0.03 increase on the low-end. 
 For the full year, our earnings per share forecast is based on approximately 324 million weighted average diluted shares, which assumes approximately $620 million of share repurchases. Our full year operating profit and earnings per share guidance are based on adjustments consistent with those detailed in our earnings release for the year-to-date results. 
 Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $550 million to $600 million, that's down $25 million from our earlier guidance, primarily as a result of our efforts to reduce the cost of our new stores and remodels. 
 We continue to plan to open approximately 650 new stores for the full year or an additional 73 stores in the fourth quarter. Remodels and relocations are expected to total approximately 550 stores for the year, or 16 in the fourth quarter. 
 We have a proven track record of serving our customers and generating strong returns for our shareholders, and we plan to continue to build on that record. 
 With that, I'll turn the call back over to Rick. 
 Richard W. Dreiling 
 Thank you, David. 2013 has turned out to be another difficult year for our core customer. Consumers are challenged by ongoing high unemployment and underemployment levels, higher payroll taxes, reduction in staff benefits and uncertainties over health care insurance and insurance costs, as well as unemployment benefits. All of these factors are contributing to erosion in consumer confidence. Yet our business model, a strong value in convenient locations, is based on consistently serving these customers in good times and bad, and we will continue to help them meet these challenges going forward. 
 Last quarter, I updated you on our major 2013 initiatives. We had completed our 2013 goals with regard to Phase 5 merchandising evolution and our cooler expansion, enabling us to expand our assortment of refrigerated foods. We are continuing to benefit from these efforts. 
 As I said earlier, the addition of tobacco products has had a significant impact on growth and our customer traffic, which I continue to believe is the most important metric with regard to evaluating the success of our tobacco initiative. We're very pleased with the progress we made in building our market share in tobacco. Going forward, we expect both traffic and transaction size to build as customer awareness of tobacco products in our stores continues to grow. 
 Looking at the fourth quarter, there are many moving parts making the quarter extremely difficult to read. Competition has gotten more aggressive on select traffic driving items, and consumers are overly cautious. All retailers will be dealing with the significant calendar shifts as the period between Thanksgiving and Christmas has 6 fewer shopping days, pushing sales closer to the Christmas holiday. 
 Thanksgiving, which came in a week later than the prior year, was essentially at the end of the month for our customer, a time when she is more pinched than earlier in the month. All that being said, we had a solid Thanksgiving day and Black Friday, both comping positive. I need to also remind everyone that Black Friday was on a payday this year, and would have some influence on consumer spending across all channels. 
 We have a strong plan in place for the remainder of the holiday season and into January when our customers are restocking their pantries after the holidays. 
 Looking forward to 2014, we're putting plans in place that build on our commitment to our 4 key operating priorities: Driving productive sales growth, enhancing gross margin, leveraging process improvements and information technology to reduce costs and strengthening and expanding our general culture of serving others. We will share more details of our 2014 initiatives when we give guidance in March. But for now, I want to share some insight into our store growth opportunities. 
 We're very pleased with the results of our new stores, remodels and relocations over the past several years. We have continue to evolve our traditional Dollar General store and make this small box model even more relevant. We currently have approximately 900 of our traditional stores in the new DG 13 format, which is a more convenient layout, improved store signage and a refreshed yellow and black color scheme. This design is delivering a comp lift above what we have seen with our previous remodels. 
 Importantly, our customers are excited about the fresh look and shopability of this new layout. We continue to refine our Dollar General Plus model, which is similar to our traditional store, but with wider aisles and significantly expanded coolers. 
 The Dollar General Plus format works very well as a replacement for an existing traditional store, where customers already know and trust Dollar General and where there is also a demand for expanded refrigerated food offering. 
 And finally, we are continuing to test new ideas in our Dollar General Market concept. For example, in the third quarter, we added fuel pumps to one of our market store in Alabama. So far, the store has surpassed our expectations. 
 At the end of the third quarter, we had 11,061 stores with 81.4 million square feet of selling space in 40 states. This year, we upgraded our site selection technology in order to fine-tune the way we look at opportunities for growth and to help us better understand the long-term potential of our small box store. 
 Our new model now estimates more than 14,000 additional opportunities for the industry, 40% higher than our previous estimate of 10,000. the sales and returns of our new stores, relocations and remodels are strong, and we believe that reinvesting in our business through store growth remains the best use of our capital. 
 In 2014, we plan to open approximately 700 new stores and to relocate or remodel approximately 525 stores, resulting in square footage growth of 6% to 7%. Our real estate pipeline is nearly 100% committed, and we are ahead of where we were this time last year. We're looking forward to opening some great new stores in 2014. 
 In closing, I want to recognize our leadership team and over 100,000 Dollar General employees who serve our customers everyday. We're in the midst of the busiest season in retail, and our customers are depending on us for convenience and every day low prices that we provide them. I want to thank all of our employees for their contributions this year, and encourage them as we embrace the opportunities and challenges of the holiday season with enthusiasm. 
 Mary Winn, I'll now open the call up for questions. 
 Mary Winn Gordon 
 All right. Lindsay, we'll take questions, please.

AMKR," 
   Amkor Technology, Inc. (AMKR) Credit Suisse Global Industrials Conference Call December  5, 2013 11:30 AM ET 
 
 Randy Abrams - Credit Suisse 
 Okay we are ready to get started on this final day. So for our next presentation we are pleased here, to have Amkor which is a leading player within the backend test and packaging. I am Randy Abrams; I cover backend actually over in Taiwan. But with us today we have Greg Johnson. We also have Joanne Solomon who is CFO of the company. She is going to start up with just a few minutes, a quick overview and business updates and then we will follow-up with questions and open up to audience. And with that I will hand it over to Joanne 
 Joanne Solomon 
 That’s great. Well, thank you everyone for joining us in Scottsdale, Arizona. Amkor is actually headquartered in Chandler, Arizona which is 20 miles south of here. So welcome everybody to the area. To get started, just a little bit of background about who Amkor is? It’s -- maybe for five minutes and then as Randy said, I will turn it over for some Q&amp;A. Amkor is the second largest outsourced assembly and test provider in the world. When you look at who our competitors are, we have two major competitors in Taiwan and one in Singapore and so it’s not surprising that Randy is headquartered out of Taiwan.  
 From the revenue standpoint, Amkor is a $3 billion revenue company and we’re the recognized packaging technology leader. And that’s important to who we are as a company and what our competitive advantages are. From the manufacturing footprint standpoint we have over 6 million square feet of manufacturing space, strategically located throughout Asia. That includes our newest factory in Malaysia that we recently acquired from Toshiba. It is a power-discrete factory.  
 And background on the supply-chain, for those of you who may not be familiar. When you look at who our customers are, I would group them into two. We have fabless semiconductor companies like the Qualcomm that doesn’t actually have manufacturing of their own and they rely on outsourcing both from a contract-foundry perspective as well as on the assembly and test side. We also have integrated device manufacturers like the Toshiba and Texas Instruments that actually have their own manufacturing; and then make decisions to outsource over, depending on their demands at our packages. 
 What distinguishes Amkor is that we see that we have the right technologies and we’re in the right end markets. Right now over half of our revenues come from communications. How we’re defining communications include both smartphones and tablets. A part of what how we’ve been able to maintain a leadership position in technology is by making sure that we are keeping pace with the changing silicon news. Whether it’s, recently it was 28 nanometer trend and we’re starting to see growth in 20 nanometer.  
 We have a reputation for high quality and solid execution. That’s actually a really important trend because we are starting to see migration from the tier-2 outsourced players back up to the Tier 1 players because of quality concerns at the Tier 2. We have strong relationships with customers. Historically, we had a concentration of U.S. and European customers. We are now increasingly focused to make sure we’re gaining share with China and Taiwan customers as well. 
 We are a leader in the advanced packaging and test technology, and well we may be the second largest to SAP, we’re the leader on the advanced side. We have a new CEO that joined us here in May. He has two principal strategic objectives that I would highlight. One is to maintain our technology leadership and the second is to make sure that we are also improving our financial performance. 
 When you look at our recent performance we’ve had relatively slacked Dow scores and we had declining profitability, and we haven’t been having the free cash flow that you would expect at a business like Amkor. So we have initiatives that Steve set out and we’re addressing. From a sales growth perspective we’re focused on both the advanced products, and make sure we’re maintaining our leadership on advanced and also to make sure that we’re having better utilization on the more mature product lines. 
 From a profitability standpoint it’s all about utilization as well as making sure we’re improving our operating efficiency. And from a free cash flow perspective with the sales growth and with improved profitability we need to also focus on making sure we’re controlling our capital investment. With those opening remarks and just referring to disclaimer slide and so people can understand the risks associated with forward-looking comments.  
 So with this I will turn it over to Randy for questions.

   The Kroger (KR) Q3 2013 Earnings Call December  5, 2013 10:00 AM ET 
 Operator 
 Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q3 2013 The Kroger Co. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Kim, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Mike Schlotman, Chief Financial Officer. Please proceed. 
 J. Michael Schlotman 
 Thank you, and good morning. Thanks for joining us today. Cindy can't join us today, so I'm going to do the introductory comments. Her daughter, Grace, is actually having an emergency appendectomy as we speak, and I haven't violated any HIPAA rules by disclosing that. Cindy was okay with me telling you why she couldn't be here. 
 Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. 
 Both our third quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] 
 Thanks again to those of you who are able to join us for our 2000 (sic) Investor Conference in New York on October 30. I will now turn the call over to Dave Dillon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Kroger. 
 David B. Dillon 
 Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's third quarter 2013 results are Rodney McMullen, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer and soon-to-be CEO; and as you've already heard, Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us for the call today is Mike Ellis, Kroger's Senior Vice President and soon-to-be President and Chief Operating Officer. 
 Our third quarter results were quite strong and helped ensure that 2013 will be another great year. Team Kroger continues to fuel our accelerated growth by performing with consistency and discipline. The resiliency of our Customer 1st Strategy to deliver for shareholders and customers was on full display during the quarter even as our internal research shows that customers remain uncertain about the economy. 
 We expanded rolling 4-quarter FIFO operating margin, excluding fuel and adjustment items. We increased return on invested capital while increasing capital investment, and we lowered operating costs as a percent of sales. And once again, this quarter, our associates' disciplined performance resulted in positive identical sales in every operating division and every store department. 
 Overall, our quarterly results show once again that Kroger is uniquely positioned to grow and win in the U.S. food retail industry. 
 I am most proud, however, of another distinctive achievement, team Kroger's 40th consecutive quarter of positive identical sales. It is not simply the scorecard that makes this meaningful, although 10 full years without skipping a beat is extraordinary. What makes 40 consecutive quarters of positive identical sales so remarkable is the underlying importance of the metric. 
 For retailers, identical sales are the strongest indication of whether or not we are connecting with our customers over time. Every one of our 343,000 associates deserves recognition for their individual work to achieve this unprecedented milestone. Congratulations. I know our entire team is hard at work to achieve the 41st. 
 We are pleased with where our business is trending, pleased with the growth of our loyal households and pleased with our business during the Halloween and important Thanksgiving holiday, all of which give us confidence that we will achieve our full year earnings per share and identical supermarket sales guidance. 
 Looking forward to 2014, we expect our earnings per share growth rate to be 8% to 11%, excluding the effect of the Harris Teeter merger and tax benefits, which is consistent with our long-term growth objective. I'll now hand off to Rodney for more details on the third quarter performance and consumer sentiment. Rodney? 
 W. Rodney McMullen 
 Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Our associates did a terrific job executing our Customer 1st Strategy in the third quarter. We improved our connection with customers, especially our most loyal shoppers and are receiving more credit from our customers because of our strong progress to improve our fresh products and customer service. As you know, these areas are important aspects of our 4 keys. 
 Before we discuss our loyal customer growth for the quarter, I want to highlight that Kroger has consistently grown loyal households for the last -- the past 10 years. We estimate that since 2003, loyal households have increased by an outstanding 83%. That means today, compared to a decade ago, 83% more households are shopping with greater print [ph], purchasing more items from our stores. Focusing on our most loyal customers has been a real key to reaching 40 consecutive quarters of positive identical sales. 
 In the third quarter, we continued to grow the number of loyal households, and our loyal household count grew at a much faster rate than total household growth, which was also up for the quarter. We have a tremendous opportunity to increase their spending across our family of stores because on average, we only capture $0.50 of every $1 loyal customer spend on products we sell. In the third quarter, loyal customers drove total sales gains in line with our strategy. 
 Our strong identical sales in the quarter were largely driven by the increases in total and loyal households. Total units in the quarter were up compared to last year, although items per trip continues to trend down as it has for the last couple of years. We believe this is a reflection of changes in shopping patterns that began with the economic downturn and have now become the norm. We estimate the rate of product cost inflation at 1.5%, excluding fuel and pharmacy. 
 As Dave mentioned earlier, we had positive identical sales in every department. These sales were exceptionally strong in produce and natural foods. These gains confirm that our Customer 1st investments in our products are working as intended and creating sustainable competitive advantages for Kroger. 
 We continue to invest to meet our customers' health and wellness needs, and this is evident in our pharmacy and the Little Clinic businesses. We are very pleased with the strong gains we've made when our pharmacy team seized the opportunity created by the dispute between Walgreens and Express Scripts, and even more pleased with the scripts that we've retained. By nearly every measure, our pharmacy team took advantage of that opportunity and ran with it. The Little Clinic likewise continues to see strong growth. 
 Many of our customers are feeling the stress of an economy that is only slowly improving, and they are not immune to the episodic ups and downs that create uncertainty. There are a number of factors impacting an already fragile consumer sentiment, including government gridlock, various concerns about health care, and it remains to be seen how the reduction in SNAP benefits will impact the entire U.S. retail industry. We continue to see high variability in sales comparisons between days and weeks. 
 What little economic recovery there is remains bifurcated. For some of our customers, the economy is markedly improved. But for others, there are no -- there has been no noticeable improvement at all. While these factors are creating more uncertainty than we normally have, we have never been more confident in our business model and we continue to gain market share. This is because of the remarkable consistency of our Customer 1st Strategy. No matter the environment, our customers and shareholders can depend on Kroger to deliver value. Our ability to make constant adjustments based on what we see in the environment and what our customers are facing has defined Kroger, in our customer's eyes, as a place they can rely on in good times and in tough times. 
 We continue to personalize and merchandise in ways that solve for the needs of all of our customers. For the customer under stress, we are offering low entry price point on key items and special low prices on seasonal items, especially in corporate brands. And for all our customers are -- and all our customers are benefiting from better service and more value through lower prices on organic and natural foods, including Simple Truth, as well as our digital promotions, fuel rewards and health and wellness offerings. 
 Corporate brands continued to gain market share during the third quarter as well, with corporate brands representing approximately 26.1% of total units sold, and sales dollars were 24.1%, excluding fuel and pharmacy. 
 Kroger leveraged operating expenses in the third quarter, as associates did a good job controlling costs and driving positive identical sales. Our OG&amp;A costs are -- costs plus rent and depreciation without fuel and the adjustment items for 2012 and '13 decreased 27 basis points as a percent of sales compared to the prior year. We are on track to deliver our ninth consecutive year of leveraging operating costs. 
 Before I turn it over to Mike, I want to provide a brief update on labor relations. Our store associate ratified new labor agreements covering stores in Little Rock, Dallas and Seattle. We are currently negotiating our contract in Cincinnati, which is on extension until March 1. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. 
 Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, should have a shared objective, growing Kroger's business and profitability, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities, plus enhance job security for all associates. In fact, over the last 5 years, we have added 33,000 jobs. 
 Now Mike will offer more detail on Kroger's third quarter financial results and our guidance for the year. Mike? 
 J. Michael Schlotman 
 Thanks, Rodney, and once again, good morning, everyone. Total sales increased 3.2% to $22.5 billion in the quarter compared to $21.8 billion for the same period last year. We know there are estimates out there that are higher than our total sales, but it's important to keep in mind that the retail price per gallon of fuel was down 8% for the quarter. This is why we look at sales excluding fuel, which increased 4.7% in the third quarter over the same period last year. 
 Net earnings for the third quarter totaled $299 million or $0.57 per diluted share. Both the current and prior year quarters benefited from certain adjustments. This year's third quarter includes a net $0.04 per diluted share benefit that is comprised of $0.05 from certain tax items, partially offset by expenses related to Kroger's pending merger with Harris Teeter. 
 Last year's third quarter included a $0.14 per share benefit from a settlement with Visa and MasterCard and from a reduction in the company's obligation to fund the UFCW consolidated pension fund created in January of 2012. Excluding these adjustments, earnings per share would have been $0.53 per diluted share in the third quarter this year and $0.46 per diluted share in the third quarter last year. 
 FIFO gross margin, including fuel, was 20.57% of sales in the third quarter. Excluding retail fuel operations, FIFO gross margin decreased 25 basis points from the same period last year. The company recorded a $13 million LIFO charge during the quarter compared to a $15 million LIFO charge in the same quarter last year. The company continues to estimate its full year LIFO charge at $55 million. 
 FIFO operating profit margin, excluding fuel, the 53rd week last year and the adjustment items in fiscal 2012 and 2013 on a rolling 4-quarters basis increased 11 basis points. On this basis and for the full year, we can continue to expect our non-fuel FIFO operating margin to expand slightly. 
 Turning now to retail fuel operations. We disclosed many items with and without fuel due to its effect on operating cost and gross rates, but we view fuel as a core department that is expected to contribute to earnings per share growth. About 1/2 of our supermarkets have fuel centers today. In the third quarter, our supermarket fuel centers' rolling 4-quarter margin per gallon was approximately $0.141 compared to $0.133 a year ago. Total gallons sold showed solid growth. 
 We increased our return on invested capital on a rolling 4-quarter 52-week basis, recording a 13.42% return on invested capital this year compared to 13.34% during the same period last year. As we increase capital, it will be more difficult to grow ROIC in the near term. However, as these investments mature, we expect them to be accretive to ROIC. 
 Our planned uses of cash remain unchanged: maintain our current investment grade debt rating; repurchase shares; have a growing dividend; and fund increasing capital investments. Net total debt was $8.2 billion, a decrease of $525 million from a year ago. On a rolling 4-quarter 52-week basis, Kroger's net total-debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio was 1.86 compared to 2.08 during the same period last year. 
 During the quarter, Kroger repurchased 3.6 million common shares for a total investment of $148 million. Over the last 4 quarters, Kroger has returned more than $752 million to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends as a result of our strong financial position. 
 Capital investment, excluding purchases of leased property, totaled $641 million for the third quarter compared to $474 million for the same period last year. Year-to-date, we have spent $1.8 billion. We expect full year capital investments to be approximately $2.4 billion. 
 As you know, we plan to continue increasing capital investment over time. This will take the form of adding square footage in markets where we believe our business model is already resonating with customers. With a better presence, we can grow our market share and ROIC. This fill-in strategy is a continuation of efforts that have been underway for some time and include a new focus on markets such as Dallas, Texas and the state of Michigan. 
 Stores we have opened in the earlier fill-in markets are producing results in line with our expectations, giving us the confidence to add new fill-in markets. Additionally, we will continue to narrow our focus on markets where we do not currently operate, with the intention of selecting one to enter organically. 
 Next, I would like to update you on our pending merger with Harris Teeter. To say we are excited about the prospects of our companies joining together would be an understatement. We know this is going to be an outstanding combination that will benefit our customers, associates and shareholders. 
 The merger is proceeding as planned. Both Kroger and Harris Teeter are having productive conversations with the FTC staff. We believe we are still on track to close the transaction before the end of Kroger's fiscal 2013. 
 Now I'll update you on our guidance for the remainder of the fiscal year. For the fourth quarter of 2013, Kroger expects identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, of approximately 3% to 3.5%. Excluding certain tax items and expenses related to our pending merger with Harris Teeter and assuming a LIFO charge consistent with our current estimate, we expect EPS to be up -- for the year, to be up in the range of $2.73 to $2.80. That's our current range. This is consistent with our long-term growth rate guidance of 8% to 11% based on our fiscal 2012 adjusted earnings per share of $2.52, and shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend that we expect to grow over time. 
 While these are fairly large ranges with one quarter to go, several factors, including the reduced SNAP benefits, a shorter holiday selling season and slow economic recovery, make it a little more difficult to precisely predict the fourth quarter. Regardless of where we finish in the range, it will be a very strong year, demonstrating the strength of our Customer 1st Strategy. I want to echo Dave and Rodney's thanks to all of our associates for your hard work to deliver what will turn out to be a very good year. 
 We do realize such a wide range of potential earnings per share results this late in the year can be somewhat confusing. It could also raise questions about where our trends are going into next year. We remain very confident in our ability to deliver 2014 results in line with our 8% to 11% earnings per share growth targets. This is why Dave discussed 2014 expectations. Normally we would not talk about this until our year end release in March, but felt it was important to be clear about the underlying confidence we have in our team and the future. 
 Now I'll turn it back to Dave. 
 David B. Dillon 
 Thank you, Mike. As you can see, Kroger delivered strong across-the-board performance in the third quarter. More importantly, we demonstrated the consistency of our Customer 1st Strategy to deliver for customers and shareholders alike. 
 Before we turn to your questions, I'd like to take a moment to thank our investors. As you know, Rodney will become CEO on January 1. While I will continue to serve as Chairman through the end of next year, Rodney will take the lead on the call next quarter. 
 I've appreciated our dialogue through the years. You have made me a better retailer as we envisioned our future. I hope you will continue to invest in Kroger in the years to come. I know I will. I could not be more confident in Kroger's future, knowing that our entire leadership team and Rodney McMullen will guide Kroger to even higher levels of performance. Now we look forward to your questions.

   Jos. A Bank Clothiers (JOSB) Q3 2013 Earnings Call December  5, 2013 11:00 AM ET 
 Operator 
 Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call for Joseph A. Bank. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. David Ullman, CFO. Please go ahead. 
 David E. Ullman 
 Good morning, everybody. This is David Ullman, and I'm joined by Neal Black, our President and CEO. 
 Before I begin, let me start with the usual script. Our statements concerning future operations contained on this call are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. 
 When used in this presentation, the words estimate, project, plan, will, anticipate, expect, intend, outlook, may, believe, goal, attempt, assume, potential, should and other similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements and information.

These interim period sales are not necessarily indicative of sales expected for the full quarter. Furthermore, sales are just one component of earnings, and no projection of earnings should be inferred from any discussion of interim period sales or other data in this presentation. 
 Now with that said, as usual, I will begin our prepared remarks this morning with an overview of our financial performance in the third quarter of 2013. Some of which we preannounced a few weeks ago, and I am pleased to say that we came in at the top end of the range we announced. Following that, our CEO, Neal Black, will provide additional color on the third quarter results, and early read on Q4 performance and an update on our business initiatives. 
 At that time, we will open our call to a live question-and-answer session, in which we will both participate. When we finish our prepared remarks, the operator will give instructions about how you may ask a question if you wish to do so. 
 With that, let me begin. 
 Our adjusted earnings for the third quarter of fiscal year 2013 were $0.51 per diluted share, representing an increase of 9% over the 47% -- $0.47 per diluted share reported in the third quarter of last year. The adjusted earnings per diluted share include the add back of approximately $1.2 million of expense of legal and other professional services related to our acquisition proposal for Men's Wearhouse. On a GAAP basis, earnings per diluted share were $0.49 in the third quarter of 2013 which is also an increase over last year, including the $1.2 million of expense for legal and other professional services. 
 We're pleased to see significantly improved sales trends in the third quarter. Our total sales grew by more than 6%, including a 23.5% gain in Direct Marketing sales. Also worth noting, at the same time as we posted higher sales, we were also able to generate a 40 basis point increase in our gross profit margin rate. This represents the second consecutive quarter in which the gross profit rate increased as they're declining for 8 quarters. To give some more specifics, for the third quarter of 2013, total sales were $247.5 million which is a gain of 6.3% compared to sales of $232.9 million in the year-ago third quarter. Comparable store sales were essentially flat in the quarter with a decline of 1/10 of 1%, primarily as a result of reduced traffic of dollars per transaction were up. More importantly, our combined comparable store and Internet sales grew 2.4% reflecting strength in our omni-channel business model. As we have entered the critical fourth quarter of 2013, our sales increased in the month of November, which Neal will discuss in greater detail in a few moments. 
 As I mentioned, the gross profit margin rate increased 40 basis points to 57.4% in the third quarter of 2013 with approximately half of the gain attributable to lower sourcing costs and the remainder related to higher average selling retails and greater leverage in our alteration services. 
 The increase in the average selling retails occurs by generating an increase in sales of seasonal clearance products as a result of weaker-than-expected sales in some previous quarters. Sales and marketing costs increased $6.9 million in the third quarter of 2013 to $100.3 million. The increase stems mostly from the higher sales compared to last year as well as occupancy, selling payroll, benefit cost and other variable cost related to the net addition of 41 stores since the year-ago third quarter. The increase in these sales and marketing costs was partially offset by approximately $700,000 of lower advertising costs reflecting an increase in the direct segment and a decrease in the stores segment. 
 The G&amp;A cost for the third quarter of 2013 were $2.2 million higher than in the third quarter of 2012 at $19.3 million, mostly attributable to approximately $1.2 million of costs related to our acquisition proposal for Men's Warehouse mentioned earlier, and approximately $700,000 related to corporate payroll and benefit cost. Despite the higher pretax profit, our tax expense was essentially flat at $8 million in the third quarter of 2013 compared to the third quarter of 2012, primarily due to a lower -- slightly lower tax rate. 
 Looking at our inventory at the end of October 2013, it shows a decrease of $11 million or approximately 3% compared to the same time last year. This lower inventory level reflects a reduction in our purchases based on the weak sell-throughs we had in certain seasonal categories last year, as well as some lower per unit inventory costs. We believe that we have a good balance of inventory to support our sales plans for the fourth quarter of 2013. 
 We deployed approximately $22.1 million of cash or capital expenditures in the first 9 months of 2013. This went towards the opening of 28 new stores, the relocation and renovation of a number of existing stores, payments for stores opened and projects completed in fiscal year 2012, which were invoiced to us and paid in fiscal year 2013. And lastly, the implementation of certain systems and infrastructure projects, including the expansion of our distribution capacity and the project to upgrade our POS system. We are on track to invest approximately $35 million to $36 million on capital expenditures for the full year of 2013 which is net of any carryover payments into 2014. This will cover the opening of approximately 30 new stores for the full year and the other items I just mentioned. 
 At this time, I will turn the call over to Neal Black, our President and CEO. 
 R. Neal Black 
 Thanks, Dave, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Let me begin with my view of our financial performance for the third quarter and the trends we have seen since the end of the quarter, and then I'll get into some operational detail. 
 As Dave discussed, our sales gains in the third quarter at 6% were solid and we're very encouraged as we execute our plans for the critical fourth quarter. We attribute this sales turnaround to the implementation of the initiatives we discussed previously. We performed an exhaustive analysis of our marketing program which has resulted in the ongoing modifications of our strategy for the high-volume promotional events, including a different approach to our media buying and multiple revised creative advertising formats. We also focused on increasing the day-to-day sales in the nonpromotional part of our business through the continued development of our Making it WORK value price campaign. Sales from this nonpromotional part of the business represented approximately 40% of merchandise sales in the third quarter and posted stronger sales gain in the rest of merchandise offerings in the chain, along with an increasing gross profit margin. We plan to continue to build on this success. 
 As we have entered the fourth quarter, we are only 4.5 weeks in. We are seeing that our total sales, comparable store sales and direct sales have all increased substantially, so the fourth quarter is off to a very good start. We're particularly happy with our strong sales in week 4 of November which includes Thanksgiving and Black Friday, and also the first week of December so far which includes Cyber Monday. Customers really responded to our combination of fresh and timely product offerings, strong door buster pricing and compelling values throughout the store. And we achieved these strong sales without deterioration in the efficiency of our advertising spending and without a deterioration of our gross profit margin rate. 
 But it is still early in the quarter and of course, December is the largest month of the quarter and the year. For some particular dynamics impacting it this year since Thanksgiving fell on the latest possible date in November, there are the smallest number of possible shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas making each day in December more important than in prior years. In addition, we are also annualizing a 53-week year in fiscal 2012 which causes a shift in the fiscal calendar, as well as one less week of sales in the fourth quarter. But again, we're off to a great start. 
 Our Direct Marketing segment, as Dave discussed, was very strong in the third quarter with a 23% sales gain which is on top of a 26% sales gain in the year-ago period. Again, timely product offerings and strong promotional pricing are the winning combination. And we continue to see Direct as a very important component of our total business. And we feel there's even more ground that can be won online. We are constantly working to drive traffic and increase conversion rates once we have a customer on our site. Profitability online, improved in the quarter primarily as a result of the benefits of our enhanced search engine optimization process that I outlined last quarter. 
 As we look ahead, we are working diligently to build on our progress by improving our marketing strategies in order to best and most productively support our stores and online businesses. Another positive note I should share is that our proprietary database of active customers for both stores and online grew 8% in the third quarter compared to the same time last year, which brings us to well over 4 million active customers. We continue to attract new customers and we recognize the opportunity this offers to build our business with them and maximize their lifetime value. We're working aggressively to capture new customers with the goal of increasing frequency of repeat visits, number of items purchased and higher average unit sales. 
 Now let me provide some insight into our merchandising gross margin trends. Our trend in the gross profit margin rate is encouraging, as Dave told you. The gross profit margin rate was up 40 basis points in the third quarter, and we believe the gross profit margin rate declines may have bottomed out and have the potential to move up as we annualize significant declines in the next 2 quarters. Our objective is to return to a gross margin rate that is more consistent with our pre-2012 levels and we feel we're on the path to get there, though it is too early to give a more specific target on the timing. 
 In the third quarter of 2013, suits had a strong increase in unit sales while sportswear unit sales were flat and other clothing and dress shirt unit sales declined. The increase in suit unit sales was primarily driven by an increase in Slim Fit suits sales and an increase in Big, Tall and Regal sizes. I mentioned that we sold less dress shirt units. We are however, pleased with this trend since the sales dollars and margin dollars have improved in dress shirts as part of our plan to increase the penetration of nonpromotional part of our business. So just to be clear, I'll repeat, suits sales were down in units but up in sales dollars and gross margin dollars due to higher average selling prices. 
 David E. Ullman 
 That was shirts. 
 R. Neal Black 
 I'm sorry, shirts. And that's a very good sign regarding the strength of our assortment in shirts. While suits sold well in the quarter, the other tailored clothing did not. We have been working hard to showcase improved business casual assortments, but we didn't get the traction that we were hoping for in the third quarter. However, parts of the business casual assortment really picked up in late November, perhaps as the weather got colder and we're now encouraged as we head towards Christmas. As we have said in the past, controlling merchandise cost without deterioration of the quality our customers expect from us is a top priority. As we mentioned on some recent calls, we expect our product cost to decline modestly through the end of 2013. However, cost declines are not directly following the declines in the commodity prices of raw materials, increases in other costs such as manufacturing labor and currency valuations are offsetting some of the commodity declines. For 2014, we see price volatility in the cotton market again with prices up for some delivery cycles and we're working our way through that. Our focus is, as always, continuing to seek the lowest cost in the world for the high qualities that we demand. 
 While maximizing the performance of our existing business as a foremost priority, we remain focused on our 5 key internal growth initiatives. Let me give you an update on where we are in each of them. Number one, our website. Beyond our search engine optimization work, we believe there is continued sales expansion potential through mobile, social marketing and our affiliate programs and international expansion. We're finding the Internet to be a great source for acquiring new customers and we have had good success with retaining these customers to purchase in multiple channels of our business. While international is only a small portion of our direct sales, it continues to grow and we have shift almost 90 countries, up from over 70 last quarter. We see even greater potential in the future for international. And as we pursue Internet sales growth, we're working hard to improve the productivity of our marketing spend. 
 Number two, our tuxedo rental program continues to grow since we launched it in early 2010. We are pleased with our spring prom season this year, which occurs mostly in the second quarter, making it a seasonal peak for the business. Rentals in the third quarter were flat with a slight increase in profitability in the quarter. We think we can do better than this and we're taking a hard look at our tuxedo marketing programs going forward. During this recent period, we've been highly focused on the core business and the related core business marketing. Now that this productivity is improving, we'll begin to refocus on the growth in tuxedos. At this time, our tuxedo rental business is not big enough to report separately and our core business still accounts for the vast majority of our sales. 
 Number three, our special sizes continue to be an important opportunity for us as We Can Fit Almost Everyone with a good portion of the business coming from our Direct Marketing segment. This reflects our ability to showcase our broad range of sizes and fits online. With traditional, tailored, slim and Regal fits and Big and Tall size extensions, we manufacture the products and control the sizing, so there can be no doubt that We Can Fit Almost Everyone. 
 I already pointed out the strength in Slim Fit suits, Regal fit suits and Big and Tall sizes in the third quarter. Every quarter, we are acquiring new customers and building new business in these areas. 
 Number four, our Factory Stores. We opened 8 more new Factory Stores this year which completes the new factory store openings for the year. These 8 new stores bring us to a total of 43 Factory Stores. And 100 Factory Stores remains our target. The factory store business continues to help us attract new customers with a different profile who are not shopping in our Full-line stores. Sales increase in Factory Stores in the third quarter while the gross profit margin rate declined somewhat as we used this channel to move excess clearance goods from prior seasons. We expect the gross profit margin in the factory channel to grow in the future as we refine the mix of clearance in new manufactured products. 
 Number five, our Full-line stores. We expect to open approximately 22 new Full-line stores in fiscal 2013, including 1 or 2 stores that will open in the fourth quarter. We remain focused on our core strategy of opening stores in convenient locations in new and existing markets on lease terms that fit our stringent criteria. Combined with our new Factory Stores, this will bring our total number of stores to approximately 630 by the end of the year, marking the increase of approximately 4% in our retail square footage. And I can confirm that our plan to open stores at roughly the same pace in 2014 bringing us closer to our goal of operating approximately 800 stores nationwide, including approximately 700 Full-line stores and 100 Factory Stores. 
 So in these 5 areas, we see growth potential for the business. Importantly, they each enable us to leverage the 4 pillars that have been constant in our business since our team arrived in 1999. Commitment to quality achieved through aggressively managed worldwide sourcing, dedication to service, being in stock with a high-quality product mix, and delivering product innovation while maintaining our classic style position. 
 Now moving ahead. While the current business trends have been stabilizing and showing renewed strength, we will continue to be proactive in growing the core business and we have a plan to return the company to a strong earnings trajectory. As we do that, we will also be pursuing an acquisition strategy that would enable us to leverage the core strength of our operating team and the infrastructure that we have built. Before we open the call for your questions, I wanted to address the topic of Men's Wearhouse. As you know, in early October, Joseph A. Bank put forward a proposal to acquire Men's Wearhouse for what we saw is a very fair price, a 42% premium to where their shares have been trading. And we even subsequently said that we will be willing to discuss a potentially higher price if the Men's Wearhouse board would be willing to provide us the opportunity for limited due diligence and enter into good faith discussions. They rejected our initial proposal and then didn't respond to us. We then remain consistent with our statements to the market and terminated our proposal. Though we said we would be willing to discuss a transaction again if the circumstances made sense. Last week, we received an unsolicited nonbinding proposal -- acquisition proposal from Men's Wearhouse. So despite the fact that they would not engage in discussions with us before, it seems they now agree that a combination of our companies make sense. We immediately responded that our Board of Directors would evaluate the proposal from Men's Wearhouse with the assistance of our financial and legal advisors and respond in due course. I can tell you that work is underway but I cannot give you a timeline of when that work will be completed to enable us to give a thoughtful response. I can assure you that we want to act expeditiously with the sole goal of delivering increased value for our shareholders, but not at the expense of distracting our management team during the most crucial selling period. 
 It is important to be aware that Men's Wearhouse is not the only potential opportunity for us. Under the leadership of our Chairman, Bob Wildrick, we have been surveying the marketplace for acquisitions for some time. As a result, there are several potential acquisition candidates we are evaluating that could meet our criteria. Of course, we cannot provide specific information about such candidates, but we can tell you that the key criteria that we use in our evaluations are: Number one, the strategic fit with our business; number two, the ability to leverage our core competencies; and number three, the accretion and opportunities for synergies that would allow us to drive substantial value creation over the long term. I cannot provide a timeline for you in terms of our efforts, but I assure you, we are being very diligent and deliberate in our work to this end. So to be clear, even as we pursue this path, our management team remains keenly focused on continuing to grow our core business and we're looking forward to being a strong competitor this holiday season and continuing to generate improvement in our performance. 
 With that said, just before we take your questions, let me note that we have received very favorable feedback from the financial community about our enhanced shareholder outreach and communication and we remain committed to that approach. In that regard, we ask you to limit your questions to our operational and financial results, and the general performance of and plans for the core business. Given the questions we anticipated about Men's Wearhouse, I felt it was important to share our thinking in our prepared remarks, and I have said most everything that can be said publicly at this time. And we appreciate your cooperation, and thanks in advance. Finally, before I close this portion of the call, let me say that our management and board are dedicated to our roles as stewards of this company and as capital for the benefit of all our shareholders. We feel very good about our core business and its recent performance, and remain committed to taking actions that will deliver increased value for our shareholders. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.

 It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Don Duda, President and Chief Executive Officer for Methode Electronics. 
 Donald W. Duda 
 Thank you, Jesse, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our fiscal 2014 second quarter financial results conference call. I'm joined today by Doug Koman, Chief Financial Officer; and Ron Tsoumas, Controller. Both Doug and I have comments, and afterwards, we will be pleased to take your questions. 
 We were very pleased to report this morning that second quarter sales grew 47% to $190.9 million, and 6 months sales grew 44% to $358.2 million. 
 Second quarter and first half sales came in higher than we expected, due mainly to strong sales for the General Motors center console programs, as well as new product launches in our European Automotive and North American Power Products operations, along with strong appliance sales. 
 As a reminder, in the second quarter of last year, we recorded a $20 million litigation settlement, which substantially benefited our profitability last year. Excluding the impact of that settlement and its effect on income tax expense, second quarter net income grew nearly fourfold, to $19.8 million or $0.51 per share. 
 For the first half, net income also grew nearly fourfold to $33.4 million or $0.87 per share, again, excluding the settlement. 
 While higher sales were the largest driver to the year-over-year improvement in both periods, increased manufacturing efficiencies due to the vertical integration of the paint and laser etch process, favorable raw material pricing and a favorable product mix in the Power Products segment and lower income taxes also contributed to remarkable growth in earnings. 
 Second quarter and first half net income was negatively impacted by increased marketing, travel and legal expenses compared to last year, as well as the absence of a customer bankruptcy accrual reversal in the year-ago quarter. 
 Additionally, we incurred increased compensation expense of $2.7 million during the second quarter and $4.4 million in the first 6 months related to our long-term incentive program. The long-term incentive awards, which are based on the company's performance in fiscal 2015 will become payable if performance under the plan meets or exceeds targeted performance. This adjustment reflects the company's estimates of fiscal 2015 performance. 
 Second quarter consolidated gross margins improved to 21.7% compared to 17.2% last year. For the 6 months consolidated gross margins improved to 21% from 17.6% in the same period of fiscal 2013. Again, the largest contributor to improvement in margins was increased sales, but margins were also positively impacted by the vertical integration, favorable raw material pricing and sales mix in the Power Products segment, as well as lower scrap on the Ford center console and General Motors K2 programs. 
 However, gross margins were negatively impacted by increased sales of products with a higher material content in the Interconnect segment. 
 Also of note, consolidated SG&amp;A as a percentage of revenues decreased to 10.3% from 11.7% in last year's second quarter. And for the first half, it dropped to 10.8% from 13.1% in fiscal 2013. 
 We are pleased with the considerable leverage realized given our substantial rise in sales. 
 As we announced this morning, we have increased fiscal 2014 guidance, now anticipating sales in the range of $720 million to $750 million and earnings per share in the range of $1.70 to $1.90. This replaces our previous guidance of $670 million to $700 million in sales and $1.40 to $1.60 in EPS. 
 This increase in sales and earnings is based on higher second quarter sales in earnings than we originally anticipated, stronger than originally projected fiscal 2014 sales for the General Motors K2 program, offset by anticipated softer second half European sales. 
 The low-end of the guidance reflects our concern regarding stabilization in the European economy, as well as potential softening in our Interconnect and Power Products segments over those achieved in the first half and possible production delays of new products. The high-end of the range anticipates stabilization in Europe and higher domestic automotive revenues, and as I mentioned on last quarter's conference call, current releases are indicating that second half European sales will be below the first half. 
 Based on the new guidance, ranges our fiscal 2014, operating margin target increases to an approximate range of 9.5% to 10.5% from the 9% to 10% we discussed last quarter. 
 Now turning to review of our individual segments. Compared to last year, Automotive segment net sales increased 57% in the second quarter and nearly 52% in the first half, due mainly to production of the General Motors K2 program. 
 Additionally, new program launches in Europe and higher sales in Asia also contributed to the revenue growth. 
 The second quarter improvement was partially offset by lower sales at the Ford center console program year-over-year. 
 At this point, we anticipate sales in the Ford center console program in the second half of this year to be approximately 10%, lower than the first half, which we have taken into consideration in our updated guidance. 
 Second quarter Automotive gross margins improved to 19.7% from 14.8% last year, and first half gross margins increased to 18.9% from 14.1% year-over-year. 
 In both periods, increased manufacturing efficiency is driven by higher sales and the benefit of the vertical integration, produced improved margins. 
 Based on anticipated sales in this segment, we believe fiscal 2014 Automotive gross margins will vary quarter-to-quarter, but will likely be in the 19% range. 
 I am also are very pleased to announce that during the second quarter, Methode was awarded a new integrated center console program for North American OEM, with final product delivery to South America and Asia. Production is slated to begin in our fiscal 2017 with annual revenue in the $15 million range. This award continues to show our capability and expertise in the center stack space. 
 Moving to Interconnect. Sales increased nearly 31% in the second quarter and over 34% in the first 6 months compared to last year, attributable mainly to improved appliance sales from our 2 largest customers. Volumes for the new laundry program came in near our expectations. 
 Radio Remote Controls sales were flat in both the second quarter and first half year-over-year. Compared to last year, Interconnect's gross margin grew slightly to 25.7% from 25.5% in the second quarter, due to manufacturing efficiencies, but fell slightly in the first half to 26.2% from 27.5%. 
 Increased laundry sales, which have higher material content than other products in the segment had the biggest impact on margins. For margins to improve in this segment, we would need improved sales in Hetronic's European industrial business. 
 Additionally, we substantially leveraged selling and administrative costs, which contributed to a 68% increase in Interconnect's income from operations in the second quarter and a 57% improvement in the first 6 months. 
 Moving to Power Products. Year-over-year sales improved nearly 50% in the second quarter and almost 47% in the first half. The launch of a significant program for datacom customer in the U.S., along with bus bars for the Nissan Leaf battery pack and a high-current bypass switch, both in Europe, drove the growth over last year. 
 While we have limited visibility, we do anticipate this run rate will continue at least through the third quarter of fiscal 2014. 
 Power Products gross margins increased in the second quarter to 26.2% from 12% last year and in the first half to 24.1% from 14.2% year-over-year. The improvement was driven by a favorable product mix, as well as lower raw material and lower new product development costs. We anticipate this segment will meet its margin targets over the fiscal year. 
 Before turning the call over to Doug, I would like to briefly discuss the updated revenue chart we posted on our website and filed as a Form 8-K this morning. These sales projections are as of today, for fiscal years 2014 to 2017. As new business awards -- our business opportunities are awarded, we will, as we have in the past, announce a significant awards on our quarterly conference calls. 
 On the revenue chart, the opportunities in fiscal's 2016 and 2017 include pending automotive wins, sales from new products and current opportunities in non-Automotive business. 
 Of note, Methode's compounded annual growth rate from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2017 is approximately 16% based on these projections. 
 Now I will turn the call over to Doug, who'll give further details regarding our financial results. 
 Douglas A. Koman 
 Thank you, Don. Good morning, everyone. I have just a few brief comments on the quarter. In the second quarter, in SG&amp;A, Don mentioned, the long-term incentive expense, the expense for the tandem cash awards was $1.7 million. This expense primarily reflects increase in our share price during the second quarter. And that would continue as we -- the stack fluctuates until the end of our fiscal 2015. 
 For the first 6 months, we spent $16.5 million for capital expenditures. For the full year, we continue to expect capital spending to be between $25 million and $30 million. This includes the additional capital needed to launch the SUV portion of the K2 program. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense for the 6-month period was $11.5 million. For the fiscal year, we expect full year depreciation and amortization to be between $23 million and $25 million. 
 For the full year, the effective tax rate is $7.6 million. This is lower than our previous estimates due primarily to increased domestic income, which is sheltered by net operating loss carryforwards. The effective tax rate does not include any adjustments to valuation allowances, which may result from charges -- changes in events and circumstances. 
 Looking at free cash flow for the full year. Given our guidance that we put out this morning, we would expect that to be between $65 million and $75 million. 
 Don, that's all I have. 
 Donald W. Duda 
 Thank you very much. Jesse, we are ready to take questions.

   Eaton Corporation (ETN) Company Conference Presentation December  5, 2013  9:45 AM ET 
 
 Moderator 
 
 We’ll get restarted with Eaton Corporation. Rick Fearon, the CFO is going to give some—a quick presentation. Also next to me is Mark Doheny from Investor Relations. 
 Richard Fearon 
 Great, thanks Julian, and I’m glad to be here today to give you an update on Eaton Corporation. Since this is pretty much the last industrial conference of the year, I’ll try to go quickly through material that I think many of you may have seen in prior presentations we’ve given and really try to give you a more current update on where things stand right now. 
 First of all, of course, we have our forward-looking statement page, which if you’d study, I’d just point your attention to some of the factors that we cite there. 
 As you know, as a company that over the last really 15 years has significantly transformed itself into a global leader in power management, managing electrical, managing mechanical, managing hydraulic power, and really the industries we serve are a very broad swath of the industrial economies around the world, pretty foundational industries for the growth of any country. We believe that we’re well positioned to deal with some of the high growth trends in the world, whether it be the demands for more efficient use of power given the increase in fossil fuel prices, which I think is far too—it’s hard to believe that we won’t see fossil fuel prices continue to increase over the median term. It’s just a function of no additional fossil fuels being created and the growth particularly in the emerging economies, but you also have a whole variety of fast-growing markets, whether it be production of food or whether it be the additional commercial airline travel. All of these are factors that are high growth factors that we are trying to position ourselves to take advantage of. 
 I think all of you know it’s a little bit old news perhaps that just about a year ago we completed the acquisition of Cooper, a very large electrical business that is quite complementary to Eaton, and we are very pleased with the results thus far, and I’ll comment on that more in a couple of minutes. With Cooper, I think all of you as well know that we reorganized ourselves and we now have two segments within our electrical sector products and systems and services, a pretty traditional way to organize your electrical business, and then the industrial sector as well, our vehicle business is really the combination of what was auto and truck, and we now run it as one integrated business. There are many common customers in the vehicle space. 
 We believe that the business we’ve created through Cooper, and I might add that we also bought four other businesses last year, and not insignificant in size. The four other businesses added about $600 million in revenue this year. The combination of all of those businesses has created a really compelling portfolio. If you look at—just looking at 2012 and pro forma-ing it for the Cooper acquisition, about half U.S., half non-U.S. Frankly, we were closer to 60% non-U.S. prior to Cooper and Cooper took us back a little ways, but we continue to believe that being predominantly non-U.S. in sales is the long term complexion of Eaton, because after all the United States is 4% of the world’s population, 23 or 24% of global GDP. Given how foundational our products are, it just makes sense that we are predominantly non-U.S. in our revenue mix. 
 Secondly, we’re very pleased that electrical is 60% of our business mix. We think that electrical businesses are very attractive. We think there are lots of opportunities for growth and for good margins, so we’re pleased with that. Hydraulics at 14%, aerospace a much small sliver given that the aerospace industry is generally a smaller industry compared to the others we participate in, and then finally our vehicle business, which is our historical business at Eaton, down really just to mid-teens kind of exposure, and we think that that’s a good balance. 
 We also think that we’ve balanced ourselves across economic cycles quite well. It’s something that we’ve consciously focused on over the years because our objective is to create a company that has higher growth, higher returns, and less volatility in the earnings streams than the Eaton of old, and we think we’ve made great progress in achieving those objectives.  
 One of the ways that we measure volatility, we think a good perspective to have, is that we simply look at what happened to our markets in the three recessions. We’ve excluded the Great Recession because we think that’s a quite unusual event, not likely to recur, so we’ve looked at the three recessions prior to that and simply looked at what the peak to trough decline in our markets was with the mix we had at the time in the three prior recessions. It used to be 10%, and then you overlay our new mix post-Cooper and we believe that the impact of a typical recession would be a peak to trough decline of only 4%. That’s obviously a significant reduction in the volatility of our markets, so that’s just one measure of how we believe we’ve created a more consistent earnings pattern. 
 In fact, another way to look at it is to look at the Great Recession itself and say, okay, what would have happened had we owned Cooper through that time period. What you see is that the volatility inclusive of Cooper is really only a fraction of what it was in actuality, and in fact the volatility was really right in the middle of our peer set with Cooper. So we think we have largely achieved that goal of creating a much more consistent earnings stream, a significant change from the old vehicle-centric days. 
 Obviously one other thing that’s happened over the last 13 years is that we’ve greatly transformed the size of the company. Our sales are almost three times what they were back in 2000. Our market capitalization—and this just looking at it as of 12/31. You look at it as of today, we’re about six to seven times growth in market cap compared to 2000. Margins up a lot, free cash flow up dramatically, so on so many dimensions we’ve dramatically changed the Eaton of old. 
 All of this has manifested itself in outstanding returns to shareholders. On average, we’ve returned 15% a year to our shareholders over a very long period of time, and whether you compare that to our peer group, which is 13 companies that we compare ourselves to, a mixture of electrical and diversified companies, companies like GE, Emerson, Danaher, Schneider, or you compare us to the S&amp;P 500 – any way you look at it, the returns have been exceptional. If you look at how we’ve gotten those returns, it’s a mixture of share price appreciation that’s about two-thirds of the return, but also we’ve consistently paid a top tier dividend yield, and our dividend yield right now is in the mid-2’s. It’s consistently been in this 2 to 3% range over the last decade, and we’re a great believer that a commitment to paying a top tier dividend is something that’s of great value to our shareholders and it’s something that we believe in as just one element of creating value for our shareholders. 
 In fact, if you look at the dividend growth that we’ve had since 2003, on average our dividend has grown at 14% a year and most recently, last February – we typically do announce a dividend increase in the first quarter – the increase was 10.5%, and it’s our expectation that we’ll continue to grow our dividend in line with our earnings growth expectations, so that probably means an increase that’s pretty similar to the increase that you’ve seen over the last decade. 
 So let me talk more specifically about Cooper, having given you that quick context about Eaton. Clearly Cooper at a $13 billion purchase price is the largest acquisitions we’ve ever done. It is complementary. I mentioned that. That’s an important distinction because some folks have said, well, why shouldn’t you have more cost savings from Cooper? Well, there is a very different dynamic in whether you buy a complementary business or you buy a completely overlapping business. Overlapping businesses have lots of opportunities to take costs out. Complementary businesses have opportunities, but they are not quite as numerous because you don’t have complete—you don’t have the ability to simply combine plants because your plants don’t make the same things. So it’s just worth keeping in mind as you think about the integration plan on Cooper. But Cooper importantly, because of its complementary nature, greatly extends our ability both upstream and downstream to provide electrical solutions, and we think that that’s an important extension of our solution capability.  
 I think you all know the Cooper products, the seven product lines, very strong product lines, very strong market positions, and really good technology that the prior management team had spent a great deal of time and money refreshing, so it’s a very vital set of products. We’ve talked about this in the past, about the various opportunities that Cooper gives us, and this just lays out in each of the product lines for Cooper some of the opportunities that are right now in motion, and as you see, the combination of Cooper and Eaton is pretty powerful in attacking those opportunities. 
 Another way to look at it is if you look at the different slices of the market and you say, what kind of participation does the combined Eaton-Cooper have, and we really have six primary areas of growth. Each are north of $1 billion of sales, some considerably north of $1 billion in sales. All of them are global, and we believe we’re well positioned to attack across the globe the primary electrical markets. Another way of looking at it, and looking at it more on a product line basis, what kinds of product lines have we put together. We believe we’ve knit together a very strong chessboard of solutions for our customers that attack lots of different verticals.  
 If you think about our electrical business now, it’s a business that’s about half U.S., half non-U.S. with the emerging markets a significant part at 20%. Slightly different mix between electrical products and systems and services. Our systems and services business has the benefit of that well-established Eaton project business that is partly a function of the Westinghouse acquisition we did in ’94. They gave us a very strong position in many medium voltage-type products, so it’s more—we have a bigger footprint in the U.S. in systems and services. Now, the other part that you should know is that we have what is generally viewed as the largest electrical service business in North America, and that’s a business we built from scratch. We don’t have anything nearly that large outside the States, so the opportunities in systems and services are to build out our project capability and to build out the service capability, because those are things we know how to do, we’re very strong in the U.S., and we just haven’t had the time to do that yet outside the U.S., so that’s clearly a work in progress but we think a significant opportunity, and one that is in flight as we speak. 
 Cooper clearly added a lot of components to us, and components are now over half of our portfolio. Components tend to have a characteristic of significant MRO usage. They tend to be products that you can spec’ed into different applications, and so we’re very pleased to add all of those components to our mix. As I mentioned, our systems at 40% is likely also to grow simply because geographically it’s overweighted towards the U.S. and doesn’t have quite the international exposure. Services as well – services is mainly North America but growing rapidly outside North America. 
 So these are the synergies that we’ve—our most recent assessment of the Cooper synergies. We have increased the Cooper expected synergies twice since the time we closed the acquisition, and really I would describe the increases as simply learning more about the opportunity. Whenever you buy a large public company, you don’t do the detailed due diligence that you would do on a smaller acquisition. You simply don’t have the ability to do that, given the confidentiality constraints and regulatory constraints, so having closed just a year ago on Cooper, over the first half of the year we had a chance to dig into all of the details of the business and that’s allowed us to find more in particular cost-out opportunities. So this year, synergies of $150 million. Sitting here in early December, I can tell you we feel quite confident in that assessment, and then for ’14 a step-up of $95 million. With the trajectory we’re on and the visibility we have right now, we feel very confident about that as well.  
 So this integration has gone very well, and in fact let me talk in more particular about the synergies because I know that’s an area a lot of folks are interested in. On the operating side, there are five areas of cost take-outs, and if you think about where we’ve started in ’13, we’ve really started on the right. Some of the first costs you take out in an acquisition like this are the corporate costs because you clearly don’t need two corporate headquarters and all of the corporate personnel associated. So we’ve taken out a lot of the corporate costs and that’s one big area of savings, and the second big area of savings is the middle column, the supply chain economies of scale, where we’ve taken advantage of the fact that we’re now so much bigger and so our spend is so much bigger across large sets of commodities, and we’ve leveraged that to achieve savings from our vendors. We’ve only gotten some of those benefits this year because many of those contracts take multiple months to negotiate, so we will certainly see additional supply chain savings next year. 
 So those are the two areas that are out of the box where we’ve made the biggest improvement. We’ve gotten a little bit of savings around the application of our Eaton business system tools, mainly plant productivity-type tools, but those take a bit longer to really ramp up. We haven’t yet gotten significant benefits from plant and distribution consolidation nor from leveraging our infrastructure, but those are in flight now. They take longer to organize and think through. A simple example is Cooper had two data centers. Well, we have two very large data centers outside Louisville, Kentucky. We could probably run $100 billion business out of our two data centers, but it takes time to migrate the Cooper data centers into our data centers. You don’t want to drop the ball when all of your ERP systems are dependent upon the data centers operating. So we have now done the planning, we expect to have the migrations in flight in the first quarter, but the infrastructure and the plant consolidations are really the task for next year. Those are the big boost in synergies next year, and the good news is that we have line of sight to all of that activity; now, we’re simply in the implementation phase. But I will tell you that plant and distribution consolidations are complex and management-intensive, and so it will be a year of lots of management implementation of those initiatives in ’14. 
 On the sales synergy side, there are four areas that we cited, and we generally are, I would say, a bit skeptical about sales synergies. If you just think about it, why should two companies coming together sell more product? I mean, in many cases that’s not an obvious thing, but in a complementary transaction like Cooper and Eaton, we have found that you can actually realize sales synergies, and we really pioneered that and proved it to ourselves from the acquisitions we did in ’08 of Moeller and Phoenixtec where we were able most definitely to realize sales synergies. So we’ve taken a page out of that playbook for Cooper, and there are four areas. 
 The first is a larger packet of to common customers, and that’s simply taking advantage of the fact that in many cases, we or Cooper was selling to a customer but only selling their product range, not the complete product range, and in particular where we’ve had a lot of success recently is oil and gas – that’s gaining speed – as well as data centers, where we each have part of the solution but not the whole solution. You put us together, we have a really compelling package, and so that’s gaining steam. 
 Boosting channel sales – that’s really gaining steam, and frankly that may—2014 will be a year when you see the channel sales really kick in. What that is, is saying Cooper and Eaton together can supply about two-thirds of a given wholesaler’s complete product range, so that’s something that’s quite attractive to a lot of wholesalers, so we are in the process, have been and will continue to be in the process of convincing wholesalers that it makes sense to make Eaton its main electrical range. Now, it takes time, one, to negotiate those, but secondly, even after you negotiate a changeover, typically we find it is not economic to buy inventory. So if a wholesaler commits to change, they typically have three to four months to burn off their existing inventory, and so this is one that takes time to ramp up. The good news is we have many commitments, we have many conversions in flight, and you will start seeing the real benefits of that in 2014. 
 The service business, we have the largest North America footprint and a growing—you know, several hundred million footprint outside of North America. Cooper didn’t service any of its own equipment despite having a very big install base, particularly in things like utility distribution transformers. They really allowed third parties, customers or others to service it, but we can take the infrastructure we’ve developed and the knowledge of how to hire and manage a service business, and we can deploy that against the Cooper install base, and that’s what we’re doing. We’ve had a fair amount of success already in doing that. 
 Lastly is the expansion in certain parts of the world where one of us or both of us were not of true scale. I mean, the Middle East is a great example. We had an okay electrical business in the Middle East. Cooper had a little bit better electrical business, but neither of us was really scaled compared to a Schneider or some of the large European competitors. You put us together, we have a scale-size Middle East business. In fact, we have a business that’s big enough that we can combine facilities and really create the kind of customer presence, customer solution capability that is necessary to truly compete effectively in the Middle East. So that’s what we’ve done, and you haven’t seen the results yet because we’ve just actually completed a lot of that consolidation, but we’re confident that we’ve got a lot of momentum in the Middle East. 
 Mexico is the same thing. Cooper was always spec’ed into Pemex installations, Pemex being the largest capital spender in Mexico, but historically Eaton had had a relatively small presence in Mexico and so we’re pyramiding off of Cooper’s strong Pemex position, as well as the position with distributors that that Pemex position got Cooper to get much more penetration in the Mexican market. So in substance, the sale synergies we’ve seen this year as well as in particular the momentum that we have seen in the last three or four months have given us confidence that, yes, we’re very definitely on track for the synergy program that we laid out. 
 So let me talk just briefly about our industrial businesses, and we shouldn’t forget that we have these industrial businesses. They are about $9 billion in revenue, so they are sizeable businesses and we think very good businesses. Our hydraulics business at $3 billion in 2012 is one of the world’s three or four global leaders in hydraulics. Aerospace, we are a leader in very particular niches, namely hydraulic field pneumatics. System then with a lesser position in the bigger electrical space, electrical control space for planes. And then in vehicle, we’re a real niche producer of transmissions and very specific engineer management parts. Just like in electrical, we’re really focusing on key growth drivers. Some of those are emerging market growth, increased demands on cost and quality, the ever-increasing cost of fossil fuels. All of those are things that we’re capitalizing on.  
 If you look at our hydraulics business, it’s a business that serves a lot of end markets. It is more mobile than stationary; in fact, we would argue the entire hydraulic space is about 70% mobile, as we are. It’s a business that uses distribution significantly, and that’s a complex element of the business. It’s one that we think we’re particularly good at dealing with, and we are pleased that despite the fact that the business as of late has had a little more volatility than it historically had had, we’re pleased at our ability to navigate through that, to still earn very good margins, and we remain very positive about the margin outlook as this business begins to see growth come back. 
 We did do two significant acquisitions last year, and we’re very pleased with them. I would say that you haven’t seen the strength of these acquisitions yet because the market has not been cooperative, but when you do see the market come back, I think you will see some very strong results out of these two acquisitions, Jeil and SEL.  
 The aerospace business, I mentioned that we focus on very niche technologies, but they are technologies that are used on every piece of equipment flying. Frankly, it would be hard to find an aircraft or rotorcraft platform that doesn’t have some Eaton equipment on it, because the aerospace industry is an industry—it’s not a very big industry. I sometimes remind people that the entire fleet of commercial aircraft in the whole world is roughly 25,000 units. I mean, 25,000 units – that’s not even as many units as Tesla is going to build this year. That gives you an idea of just how tiny a business it is, but it’s a business that’s a very good business, a lot of technology, a complex business. It’s one that we’re really good at, and we’re very pleased at the performance of the business and in particular with the wins on fast-growing platforms that we have, things like the 787, the Joint Strike fighter, the new tanker program for the military. We have a lot of growth platforms in this business and it’s something that requires a lot of management, a lot of engineering management because of all of the development work underway, but one that we think will pay off. 
 The other thing is the commercial aftermarket does finally seem to be recovering. The commercial aftermarket disappointed a bit in the first half of the year, growing less rapidly than air travel grew, but it does appear to be getting back into line with the more typical growth patterns that we’ve seen over time.  
 Vehicle, it’s a big business, about $4 billion, very geographically spread, strong positions in a variety of light vehicle, medium and heavy truck, as well as agricultural applications. We earn very good margins. We’ve had a mixed set of conditions this year. We’ve had Class 8 trucks in North America not be as strong as people had thought, but I always ask people to put it in context. Yes, it didn’t grow this year, but it didn’t decline very much either. Really, the Class 8 market has been pretty flat for the last three years, and flat at relatively robust levels, so that’s certainly a pretty good dynamic for us. The truck markets in Brazil have been really strong this year, growing 35 to 40%. Agricultural transmission very strong this year, and generally light vehicle markets in many parts of the world have been very strong, and we think that that strength persists. 
 So let me talk quickly about growth and then I’ll turn it over to Julian for some questions here. Our model over the long haul, over full cycles is 8% revenue growth, 6% organic, 2% acquisitions. We do have a pretty good record of doing acquisitions. We have done 65 of them in the last 13 years. We’ve acquired about $12 billion of revenues on an annual basis. The organic side really is we think—if you look at our markets, we think that our markets grow about 4% on average. That’s faster than world GDP growth, which we would peg at about 3% growth – I’m talking real numbers – and we think that we have an ability to outgrow by about 2 points or 50% of our market growth. That’s really a reflection of penetrating markets that we are less penetrated in. Even as big as we are, there certainly are significant parts of the world where our share position isn’t what we think it can be, and also the introduction of these bevy of new products that we’ve been working on. We do spend $600 million to $700 million a year on R&amp;D, and we have not really altered that in any significant way. Even in the Great Recession we didn’t really alter that, so we’ve got a lot of new products being introduced, a very vital product portfolio. 
 This gives you our feel for margins. It’s not any different than the guidance we gave at the end of the third quarter. A big step-up in margins this year to 15.25 is our expectation, and we continue to think that this 2015 target of 17 is something that is doable. It’s certainly our aspiration to make that happen, and as we’re doing our planning this year, we’re giving strong thought to the trajectory that ’14 puts us on. 
 We generate a lot of cash – $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion of operating cash flow this year. I’d point out that that is the classic definition of operating cash flow. It’s after pension contributions, for example, and so we are a company that has a lot of resources at its command. We did end the third quarter with $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion of cash on our balance sheet. We typically generate most of our cash in the third and fourth quarters. Often, the fourth quarter is our highest cash generation quarter, so we would expect to end the year with a good amount of cash on the balance sheet. 
 Really no change in our expectation of markets. A disappointing year from a market growth – zero percent growth this year, but in our view that’s a function of a lot of the uncertainties that occurred across the year, in particular a lot of the political uncertainties about resolution of the debt ceiling and coming up with a federal budget, the fact that China was in a transition period, the fact that Brazil had a variety of issues that caused some uncertainty. For example, Brazil’s growth, you may have seen third quarter GDP came out a couple of days ago. It was actually minus 2%, which is sort of interesting. It reflects some of the difficulties that Brazil is slogging through. 
 I think you all know our overall guidance for the year. Essentially on zero percent market growth, you can view the core growth of $125 million as essentially the outgrowth for this year, $125 million of outgrowth.  
 Lastly, expectations for ’14 – we believe that if you think about from a macro level, what’s really happening is that the world growth is picking up from pretty modest 2.3%-ish growth this year to a number that’s more like 2.75 to maybe as much as 3%. Where is that pickup? Well, it’s mainly in the U.S. and Europe. So what’s going to be odd about next year is a year where the U.S. and Europe rebound, and where normally we’ve seen acceleration in emerging markets, we don’t think you’re going to see that next year. We think it’s the U.S. and Europe. And maybe even more important than a pickup in the U.S. and Europe in overall growth is we think industrial production will reverse this unusual pattern we’ve seen where industrial production for the last two years globally has grown at 70 to 100 basis points less than GDP growth. We think 2014 is a year where you’ll probably see industrial production ahead of this 2.75 to 3% global GDP growth, and so that’s the backdrop of why we think our markets are likely to go 3 to 4%. 
 I talked about the Cooper synergies incremental of $95 million. We think we’re likely to see a modest decrease in pension expense on the order of $20 million. It’s a very complex set of calculations involving the final discount rate and the final asset return, so it’s hard to forecast this very accurately. Interest expense comes down a little bit because we are paying off scheduled debt maturities, debt we took down—or some of the debt we accumulated at the time of Cooper. And our tax rate, we think is 8 to 10%, buttressed by the fact that we are an Ireland domiciled corporation, and with the way we’ve structured ourselves around the world over these last decade. That tax rate is pretty consistent with the kind of tax rate you’ve seen that we’ve had for most of the last 10 years. 
 So that’s our outlook. We feel the next year is likely to be a somewhat more robust year than this year. We’re looking forward to a little bit of global growth in our markets. We’re looking forward to realizing these additional Cooper synergies, and so to us it feels like it should be a pretty good year next year. 
 With that, Julian, why don’t you jump in with any questions.

   Francesca's Holdings (FRAN) Q3 2013 Earnings Call December  5, 2013  8:30 AM ET 
 Operator 
 Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Francesca's Holdings Corp.'s Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Randi Sonenshein, Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am. 
 Randi Sonenshein 
 Good morning, and welcome to Francesca's third quarter fiscal 2013 conference call. 
 Earlier this morning, the company issued a press release outlining the financial and operating results for the third quarter ending November 2, 2013. The following discussions may include forward-looking statements. Please note that actual results may differ materially from those statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projected results is contained in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 We will begin today's call with Neill Davis, our Chief Executive Officer, who will comment on our third quarter performance and strategic initiatives. Mark Vendetti, our Chief Financial Officer, will then provide financial highlights of the third quarter, as well as details of our financial outlook for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2013. 
 Following prepared remarks, we will be pleased to address your questions. As usual, the text of today's conference call, along with detailed management commentary, will be posted to our corporate website. 
 I'll now turn the call over to Neill. 
 Neill P. Davis 
 Thanks, Randi, and good morning, everyone. We delivered third quarter results within our guidance range, in a challenging retail environment, in light of diminished transaction trends and fashion transitions in certain of our offerings. Compared to the prior year, sales of $79.6 million grew 15%, and that's based on a restated National Retail Federation retail calendar, reflecting largely our ongoing new boutique opening activities. 
 Our direct-to-consumer business continues to show brand resonance with our customer, with 87% growth in the third quarter and we opened 10 new boutiques, bringing our quarter end total to 86. Comparable boutique sales, which decreased 3% in the quarter, were driven by lower transaction counts. In this tough environment, we leveraged the flexibility and speed afforded by our buying strategy and built into categories where we saw opportunities. 
 This resulted in an improved performance level in the final month of the quarter. Given the negative transaction trends and highly promotional environment, I am pleased that for the third quarter, we were able to maintain healthy product margins in the high 60s range. However, challenges remain and were acutely present in November in the final week of the month, as transaction levels we expected were not realized during the Black Friday weekend. 
 Given our slow start to the holiday season, we are lowering our expectations for the fourth quarter and are adjusting our forward business planning to properly align our inventory investments to the updated outlook. Throughout the third quarter, our merchandise performance reflected strength in emerging offerings such as sweaters, bottoms and footwear. We were pleased with the strong response to these new styles and their expanded presence in our boutiques. However, these were offset by the absence of strong trends in our fashion tops, jewelry offerings and the ongoing transition in our gift assortment that we have spoken to in earlier calls. Jewelry has long been a strong performing category of francesca's, and I anticipate this trend to continue. However, this category is evolving, as we are moving towards more metal materials compared to our dominant color themes. This shift in materials favors silhouettes such as earrings and bracelets and diminishes the importance of necklaces. We have been and are continuing to make adjustments and expect to see the benefits during the first quarter of 2014. Within our accessories business, our footwear grew over 50% to the prior year, contributing 1 point of comp to the total. Footwear represented 20% of accessory sales and 4% of company sales. 
 Our gift and home offering sales declined during the third quarter, representing a decrease of 2 points of comp to the total. However, gifts showed sequential improvement across the quarter and into November. We have now largely converted our -- over our assortment to the more fun and functional occasion-based themes that enhance the overall shopping experience at francesca's. We believe our merchandise strategies for the upcoming spring season of 2014 reflect trends in color, fabrication and silhouette, and should appeal to the sensibilities which have historically performed well for us, coupled with a dose of special and unique that our customers respond well to. With 87 locations open as of today, we will take possession of 4 boutiques during January 2014, which were originally slated for opening during the first quarter of fiscal 2014. This will bring total new boutique openings for fiscal 2013 to 91, reaching the halfway mark of our domestic goal of 900 boutiques. 
 As I look to fiscal 2014, we have identified 84 new boutique locations thus far. Of these, we have already executed leases for 60 locations. We continue to work diligently and invest appropriately in extending the reach of the francesca's brand, specifically growing distribution in our direct-to-consumer channel. Year-to-date, and supported by a refresh of our web portal, enhanced functionality and expanded style offerings, our direct-to-consumer business has processed over 10 million visits, 60 million page views, contributing to a 91% sales growth rate, with improvements across all productivity measures: conversion, average order, value and units per order. We remain focused on driving improved content, with increased fashion options and styling advice refreshed frequently. 
 Building out our teams and infrastructure is an important element of our long-term growth and return objectives. To that end, we have been proactively making investments throughout the year to enhance our abilities to deliver our brand experience to a broader market via the direct-to-consumer channel, as well as to enhance the differentiated feel of our boutique experience, with an expanded field leadership organization. Although these investments were aligned with expected revenue growth, given the diminished actual and updated forward sales growth rates, leverage from these investments will likely be realized during next year. 
 As I've said in the past, we believe we have a distinctive business model and we remain committed to operating our business with a disciplined approach, appropriately balanced to address both our short- and long-term business objectives. 
 Now let me turn the call over to Mark to review our financial performance in more detail for the third quarter and provide fourth quarter and full year guidance. And then after that, we'll take your questions. 
 Mark J. Vendetti 
 Thanks, Neill. And good morning, everyone. Total company net sales for the third quarter increased 11% to $79.6 million or 15% on a restated NRF retail calendar. The adjusted retail calendar impacted total revenue in the third quarter of 2012 by decreasing the base total by $2.5 million. Overall, net sales increase was driven by 87 new boutiques opened since the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2012, with 10 opened during the third fiscal quarter of 2013. Comparable sales decreased 3%, including direct-to-consumer. This compares to a 17% increase in comparable sales in the same period last year, which has been restated to include direct-to-consumer sales. As Neill highlighted in his comments, this decrease was driven by a 3% decrease in comparable transaction volume, which we believe reflects the combination of weaker overall fashion trends, transition in certain of our offerings and lower traffic. Comparable average transaction size was flat to last year. 
 Net sales in our direct-to-consumer business grew 87% to $2.2 million, with improvements in traffic, conversion and average transaction size. We are pleased with the performance of our direct-to-consumer business as a result of the upgrades to the website earlier during the fiscal year. Through the end of the third quarter, we opened 86 new locations and have plans for 5 additional boutiques in the fourth quarter, bringing the total base to 451. This is higher than our original plan, as we are pulling 4 of our 2014 planned store openings into the end of January in order to capitalize on additional revenue opportunities, as well as the ability to keep the number of openings during fiscal 2014 at the full planned number by backfilling 4 accelerated openings during fiscal 2014. On a year-to-date basis, new boutiques continue to perform within 10% of same-store sales productivity. In the third quarter, we saw college market boutiques increase in productivity in September as the students returned to campus, and our aggregate levels of cannibalization from new boutiques remains low. Gross profit as a percentage of sales declined 190 basis points to 50.7%, primarily due to deleverage on the occupancy costs. In addition, merchandise margins were lower by 30 basis points, reflecting higher markdown levels compared to the prior year, particularly in gifts and jewelry as we transition assortment. The decline in merchandise margins were within our expectation for the quarter. Our promotional activity was somewhat higher than the prior year, but concentrated in incremental jewelry events and targeted boutique additional percent-off clearance. 
 Selling, general and admin expenses increased 28% to $25.8 million, compared to prior year period of $20.1 million. As a percentage of net sales, SG&amp;A was 32.4% versus 28% of sales in the prior year quarter. Within our SG&amp;A, selling had deleverage of 300 basis points and G&amp;A expenses had deleverage of 140 basis points versus last year. As Neill talked about earlier, we are building our infrastructure in order to support our short- and long-term growth objectives. 
 During the quarter, we completed the expansion of our field organization. This expansion is targeted to establish the direction, training and oversight mechanism needed -- necessary to enable our boutiques to achieve the desired productivity levels as we grow to 900 domestic locations. We have increased our investment in our home office teams in the merchandising and IT groups by adding staff and investing in our direct-to-consumer business. Income from operations was $14.6 million, with operating profit margin of 18.1%, as compared to 24.6% in the prior year period. Net income totaled $8.7 million or $0.20 per diluted share, compared to $10.8 million or $0.24 per diluted share in the prior year period. 
 Turning to the balance sheet. Total inventories at the end of the quarter increased by $7.1 million to $30.6 million. Ending inventory was up 30% or 5% on a per average location basis. Given inventory carryover in fashion tops, dresses and colored jewelry, we expect merchandise margin pressure in the fourth quarter of approximately 50 basis points below the prior year. We currently expect to match the promotional intensity levels of the last year. We ended the quarter with $31.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, an increase from $12.9 million at the end of the prior year quarter, and $29.9 million at the end of 2012. In addition, the company drew $25 million of our revolving credit facility during the quarter, which remains outstanding at the end of the quarter. Also, during the quarter, we repurchased 1.9 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $19. 
 Now turning to fourth quarter and full year guidance. First, I want to remind everyone that fiscal year 2012 was a 53-week year. The incremental week in fourth quarter 2012 contributed $3.9 million in net sales, and approximately $0.03 per diluted share in earnings. For the fourth quarter, we expect net sales to be between $90 million and $95 million, an increase of 9% to 15% over the prior 13-week period in 2012 ending January 26, 2013. Comparable sales, including DTC, are expected to be in the range of minus 8% to minus 3%, compared to a 10% comparable sales increase in the fourth quarter of last year. Additionally, we plan to open 5 new boutiques during the quarter. Net earnings per diluted share are expected to be in the range of $0.25 to $0.29, compared to fourth quarter 2012 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.33. This guidance includes similar growth rates in selling-related expenses and corporate G&amp;A expenses within the recent third quarter, that are largely payroll-driven, as I've previously mentioned. 
 In addition, lower legal costs in the prior year fourth quarter will contribute to higher SG&amp;A growth rates in this year's fourth quarter. Also, we expect gross profit as a percent of sales deleverage less in Q4 than in Q3. 
 Moving to the full fiscal year 2013. We now expect net sales to be in the range of $338.2 million to $343.2 million, an increase of 16% to 17% over the prior 52-week period in 2012 ending January 26, 2013. Comparable sales, including DTC, are expected to be in the range of minus 3% to minus 1% for the 2013 fiscal year period, compared to 16% for the 2012 fiscal year comparable sales. We plan to open 91 new boutiques, approximately 1/2 of those will be mall-based. 
 Adjusted net earnings per diluted share are now expected to be in the range of $1.03 to $1.07. This compares to the 52-week prior adjusted diluted earnings of $1.04. This year's adjusted earnings exclude $0.6 million net of tax for a secondary equity offering in the first quarter. Last year's adjusted earnings include, net of tax, $0.5 million for a secondary offering; $0.2 million related to stock option acceleration expenses; and $0.2 million for the relocation of our headquarters and distribution facility. The effective tax rate is estimated to be 39.3% for the fourth quarter and the full year. Capital expenditures for the full year are planned in the range of $25 million to $26 million. 
 This concludes our prepared comments for the quarter. We will now take your questions. Operator?

 Geoffrey S. M. Hedrick 
 Thank you, Ron. In the fourth quarter, we reported revenues of $8.0 million, up 16% from a year ago and net income of $155,000 or $0.01 per share. The 2012 Q4 earnings of $0.17 per share benefited from a one-time $0.15 per share tax adjustment. These results conclude a strong year, in which we were profitable in each quarter and profitable for the fifth consecutive year, while we invested heavily for the future growth and profitability. 
 Including nonrecurring items for each year, the underlying earnings per share were $0.15 this year versus $0.03 in 2012. For the year, we increased revenues 28%, booked over $100 million in new orders and saw the backlog increase more than fourfold from just under $20 million a year ago to over $90 million today. 
 At this time, we invested -- at the same time, we invested $10.9 million or more than 34% of our revenues in both engineering development and internally funded R&amp;D to bring several new programs to market. Our Engineering Development Contracts are limiting gross margins currently. However, our growth is attributable to our consistent commitment to invest a high percentage of revenues in product development to capture the many and growing opportunities. This fiscal 2014 -- as this fiscal 2014 progresses, several of these new programs and development will be completed with product certification and begin production where we expect to provide and contribute to our future growth and increased margins. 
 The success of our display and air data products is contributing to the growing number of satisfied customers. Our new Flight Management System, GPS sensors and other NextGen air traffic control products are attracting interest from operators seeking better performance for price value proposition. 
 Our combination of demonstrated value-added products and innovative new technologies is creating opportunities for us in the value-focused marketplace. We continue to be optimistic as we begin fiscal 2014. A $90 million backlog provides us with a reasonable expectation for another year of revenue growth and profitability in fiscal 2014. 
 Our backlog excludes $90 million of potential long-term -- additional long-term sole-source OEM production revenue. During the course of fiscal 2014, we will complete several Engineering Development Contracts, and the resulting products will receive FAA certification and enter their production phase. These products enter the market -- as these products enter the market, we expect to attract additional customers who have awaited this certification. During fiscal 2014, we expect to maintain our high level of investment in product development in the range of 30% to 35% of revenue. Our objective is to continue to capture a greater share of the expanding addressable market as we increase our number of product offerings. 
 Now let me turn this over to Ron for a detailed description of our financial performance. 
 Ronald C. Albrecht 
 Thank you, Jeff. The company reported its seventh consecutive profitable quarter for 3 months ended September 30, 2013. For the quarter, revenue was $8 million, an increase of 16% from $6.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. Net income was $155,000 or $0.01 a share compared to $2.8 million or $0.17 a share for the same quarter of last year. 
 Included in the results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 was a nonrecurring tax benefit, which added $2.4 million or $0.15 per share to net income. 
 Total expenses for the quarter were $2.1 million, down from the fourth quarter of last year because of a decrease in internally funded engineering -- internally funded research and development and more -- as more engineering resource was devoted to fulfilling Engineering Development Contracts. However, the combined spend in support of Engineering Development Contracts and internally funded R&amp;D was approximately $3.2 million, a 40% increase for the quarter, which is a 34% increase from the same period a year ago. 
 General and administrative expenses for the quarter were $1.8 million, down sequentially from the third quarter, which included a nonrecurring item, and up less than $50,000 from the year-ago quarter. The underlying level of general and administrative expenses has remained stable over the past 4 quarters. We do not expect it to increase appreciably in the near term. 
 We reported fourth quarter operating income of $47,000, down from $373,000 for the fourth quarter of 2012. In the fourth quarter, we recorded a tax benefit worth $91,000, primarily to adjust the tax expense for the year to reflect the actual full year tax rate. In the year-ago quarter, we recognized a nonrecurring benefit of $2.4 million from a reversal of an income tax valuation allowance. Net income for the fourth quarter this year was $0.01 per share compared to $0.17 per share a year ago. For fiscal 2014, we expect to return to a more normal effective tax rate of approximately 25%. 
 At September 30, 2013, the company had $16.4 million of cash on hand, a little change from the past 3 months, but down substantially from a year ago as a result of special tax dividend of $25 million paid to shareholders in December 2012. Cash used in operating activities was $567,000 in the quarter. The company remained debt free. 
 Timing differences between spending and customer payments on Engineering Development Contracts has caused fluctuations in cash flows from operations. We expect the net use of cash from operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. However, we believe that we have sufficient cash to fund operations for the foreseeable future. These timing differences will reverse as Engineering Development Contract programs reach payment milestones and provide a source of cash. 
 For fiscal 2013, revenues were $31.6 million, up 28% from the $24.6 million in fiscal 2012. Net income was $1.9 million or $0.11 per share for the year compared to a net income of $3 million or $0.18 per share for fiscal 2012. A nonrecurring legal charge reduced 2013 earnings by $657,000 pretax or $0.03 per share after tax. Net income and earnings per share for fiscal 2012 include the previously mentioned tax benefit from a reversal of an income tax valuation allowance. Cash used in operating activities was $2.2 million for fiscal 2013 compared to a positive cash flow from operating activities of $1.4 million for fiscal 2012. 
 In fiscal 2013, cash was used primarily to fund Engineering Development Contracts, under which we would expect to receive payment in 2014 and beyond as contract milestones are reached. 
 For the fiscal year ended September 2014, we expect to increase sales and generate profit, which would represent our sixth consecutive profitable year. The introduction of new products into production will result in some increase in margins. For the first quarter, we expect revenues to increase from a year ago, and we expect to be profitable, although we expect an operating cash outflow for the quarter because of the aforementioned timing differences on Engineering Development Contracts. 
 I'll now turn the call over to Shahram Askarpour for further comments on market conditions and operations. Shahram? 
 Shahram Askarpour 
 Thank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. The fourth quarter reflected continued improvement across our business with year-over-year revenue growth, the new production orders for existing products and accelerated progress with our Engineering Development Contract. 
 For fiscal 2013, revenues were at the upper end of our 20% to 30% revenue target for the year. Profit shortfall was a result of increased demand and engineering development hardware impacting production deliveries. 
 In the fourth quarter, we experienced the challenge of ramping up production, while simultaneously introducing newly developed products into production, and we did not respond as well as we expected. We have since reorganized and strengthened the leadership in our manufacturing organization and expect to see significant improvements in that area. 
 Production shipments of Flat Panel Display products were up 31% in fiscal 2013. These products remain in high demand as 2/3 of our fourth quarter bookings were for existing line of Flat Panel Display products. Sales of our existing products represent a base upon which we build sales of our new products as they complete certification and enter production. We continue to make excellent progress on all of our Engineering Development Contracts, several of which are nearing completion. 
 For Delta Air Lines, we are developing a suite of navigation and display products equivalent in capability to that available in the latest generation of aircraft. We expect to begin deliveries in mid-calendar 2014. 
 Our new open-architecture utility management system for the Pilatus PC-24 Boeing business jet aircraft is entering the third year of a 4-year development with production expected in 2016. Upon completion of this contract, we will have developed a complete aircraft avionics suite with potential application beyond the Pilatus program. 
 Our development on Eclipse E550 program is nearing its final stages, which will result in an open-architecture integrated cockpit with dual flat management computer, Attitude and Heading Reference System, RVSM air data system, model throttle and radios. We are continuing to coordinate effects with Eclipse in the FAA to complete certification of the aircraft, which we expect to enter production in the first half of this fiscal year. 
 Our aerial refueling control display unit for the KC-468 tanker program is in the final qualification phase. We expect the completion of the qualification phase to be followed by delivery of preproduction units in the third and fourth fiscal quarters of 2014 to support Boeing flight test program, and production phase of this contract is anticipated to begin in our fiscal year 2015. 
 The Foreign Military C-130 transport program development is progressing well. Product deliveries are planned for initial aircraft integration in the first fiscal quarter of 2014, and that's the quarter that we are in now. The IS&amp;S Flight Management System certification for the Classic Boeing 737 fleet of National Nuclear Security Agency is in company flight testing to be shortly followed by FAA final certification testing. 
 When the engineering phases of each OEM program is complete, we enter sole-source production and expect to have multiyear orders from each of these customers. New orders for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 were $8.2 million. These included a mix of production orders for existing display and air data products. For fiscal 2013, we received over $100 million of new orders. Backlog was $91.1 million at September 30, 2013, a greater than fourfold increase from backlog of just under $20 million a year ago. The Engineering Development Contracts have produced a requirement for additional engineering resources. The fourth quarter has supplemented our core staff with additional outsourced engineering capabilities to help us address the increased workload. 
 This outsourced engineering resource enables us to add skilled and technical expertise quickly, while retaining flexibility in our cost structure. We expect that these temporarily additional resources will help us with the completion of several of these engineering development contracts and transition into production phases. As each of these engineering programs enter the production phase, we expect profits to grow higher and become more consistent with our historical experience. 
 In summary, the fourth quarter represented the culmination of a year of growth, progress and profitability. We look forward to continuing revenue growth during fiscal 2014 at a rate of 20% or so. With a strong backlog, the completion of several Engineering Development Contracts and growing market recognition for our products, we are confident that we are positioned to continue to achieve meaningful growth this year and beyond. 
 I would now like to turn the call back to Jeff. 
 Geoffrey S. M. Hedrick 
 Thanks, Shahram. The results for fiscal 2013 illustrate the growing demand for our products as we continue to offer products at an exceptional price-performance value proposition and at a time when the market has become increasingly value-sensitive. Revenues, operating profits, bookings and backlog are all substantially higher in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012. We increased both production and Engineering Development Contract revenues as we balanced delivering positive current financial results with investing for the future. 
 We are fortunate to have customers willing to share in the cost of these development programs and the cost of developing new products. In the near term, we have sacrificed some margin to capture the longer-term growth opportunities. These investments have not prevented us from delivering value to our shareholders, however. As our Engineering Development Contracts complete, we will enter in more profitable production phases of the related programs. We believe that we will build shareholder value as a result of our current investments. For fiscal 2014, execution on our commitments is our primary objective. I want to comment on one thing as well, the backlog. We had mentioned backlog and how it's growing, et cetera. It's important to understand that we only attribute orders which have firm release schedules to our backlog. There are many production programs in which we anticipate as much as 2x or 3x what our existing orders are. So the only thing that we have in backlog -- what we refer to backlog is orders that have a defined delivery schedule of specific quantities of products. 
 Okay. Operator, I want to turn it over for questions. Go ahead.

   J. Crew Group (JCG) Q3 2013 Earnings Call December  5, 2013 11:00 AM ET 
 Operator 
 Greetings, and welcome to the J. Crew Group, Inc. Third Quarter Fiscal 2013 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Allison Malkin of ICR. Thank you. You may begin. 
 Allison C. Malkin 
 Thank you for joining us to review our third quarter 2013 results. With me today are Jim Scully, Chief Operating Officer; Libby Wadle, President of our J. Crew brand; Stuart Haselden, Chief Financial Officer; and other members of our management team. 
 Before we begin, I would like to remind you of the company's Safe Harbor language, which I'm sure you're all familiar with. The statements contained in this conference call, which are not historical fact, may be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual future results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, all of which are described in the company's filings with the SEC and in the press release issued in connection with today's call. Please note, at the time of this call, we are in a process of filing our Form 10-Q with the SEC. A copy of our third quarter financial statement and our management discussion and analysis has been provided to the agent prior to this call. 
 During this call, we will refer to adjusted EBITDA, which adjusts for items such as noncash share-based compensation, as well as the impact of purchase accounting resulting from the acquisition in 2011. We believe that adjusted EBITDA provides an important measure of our profitability and performance, as well as our liquidity. You can find a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA in Exhibit 3 of our press release. 
 With that, I will now turn the call over to Jim Scully. 
 James S. Scully 
 Thanks, Allison, and good morning, everyone. I will provide a brief overview of our results and then Stuart will walk you through our financials in more detail. We will then open up the call to your questions. 
 In the third quarter, we experienced a sequential improvement in our year-over-year results, achieving a double-digit increase in total revenues, as well as adjusted EBITDA. Specifically, total revenues increased 11%, with total company comparable sales increasing 5% on a realigned basis. This is on top of a 16% increase in total revenues for the third quarter last year, and a 10% increase in total company comparable sales. 
 Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $110 million, representing a 12% increase to last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was essentially flat to last year at 17.8% of total revenues. On a year-to-date basis, total revenues increased 10%, with total company comparable sales increasing 3%. This was on top of a 20% increase in total revenues year-to-date last year and a 13% increase in total company comparable sales. 
 Adjusted EBITDA totaled $294 million, a 2% increase to last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin declined to 16.9% from 18.2% for the same period last year. 
 In the third quarter, we continue to realize the benefits of the strategic investments that we have made since going private in 2011. We continue to grow our J. Crew retail footprint and year-to-date, we've added 18 new units. We have steadily grown our retail store base in the U.S., as well as Canada and officially expanded beyond North America in October when we opened our men's shop on Lamb's Conduit Street, and this was followed by the opening of our Regent Street flagship store in our Brompton Cross women's collection boutique, also located in London in early November. 
 Our direct business continues to be an important part of our growth strategy, and we have been very pleased with the results of the investments we have made in this channel. We continue to learn from the international component of our direct business where we currently ship to over 100 countries. We have been able to leverage the results from this channel to target investments and to inform the growth strategy of our international retail stores. 
 This October also marked the 1 year anniversary of our J. Crew factory site. As you may remember, this began as a weekend-only sight in September 2011. Based on the strong initial results and the overall strength of our factory brand, we launched the standalone site last year and have been very pleased. 
 Lastly, our Madewell business continues to perform well. We've added 17 new stores this year, in consistent with J. Crew, continued to invest in the online portion of this business, which is a critical component of Madewell's growth and profitability. We are pleased with the impact our investments and these key strategic growth initiatives have had on our business and remain focused on driving long-term, high-quality earnings growth. 
 With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Stuart to review our financials in more detail. 
 Stuart C. Haselden 
 Thanks, Jim. Turning to the details of the third quarter. Total revenues increased 11% to $619 million. Total comparable company sales, which include sales from stores opened at least 12 months, direct sales and shipping and handling revenues were up 5% on a realigned basis. This is on top of a 10% increase last year. 
 Our store sales increased 7% to $420 million, net square footage increasing 8% versus last year, driven by 15 net new store openings during the quarter. 
 Direct-sales, which includes our J. Crew Factory and Madewell direct businesses, increased 21% on top of a 13% increase last year. 
 Gross profit was $271 million, with gross margin of 43.9% compared to 47.3% last year. Merchandise margin decreased 270 basis points year-over-year due to increased markdowns and accounted for the majority of the gross margin deterioration. Additionally, our buying and occupancy expense rate increased 70 basis points year-over-year. 
 SG&amp;A dollars were flat to last year at $189 million, with SG&amp;A rate decreasing to 30.5% from 33.9% last year. This year reflects a $7 million year-over-year decrease in share-based and incentive compensation. Excluding this item, SG&amp;A as a percent of revenues decreased 220 basis points from last year. It's important to note we carefully managed our expenses in the quarter while protecting investments in our key growth initiatives. 
 Operating income for the third quarter was $83 million or 13% of revenues. Adjusted EBITDA, as outlined in Exhibit 3 of our press release, was $110 million in the third quarter compared to $99 million last year. Adjusted EBITDA as a percent of revenues was 17.8% or essentially flat to last year. 
 Net interest expense for the second quarter totaled $26.5 million compared to $24.1 million last year. 
 Turning to key balance sheet highlights. Cash and cash equivalents were $78 million at the end of the third quarter versus $196 million last year. Total debt remained essentially flat to last year at $1.6 billion. 
 Our inventory balance was $418 million at the end of the third quarter compared to $349 million at the end of the third quarter last year. Inventory increased 20% versus last year or 11% on a per-square-foot basis. 
 Capital expenditures for the third quarter were $40 million. We expect capital expenditures to total approximately $135 million for fiscal 2013. This reflects key expenditures to support our growth initiatives, including new store openings, information technology enhancements, store renovations, and warehouse and corporate office improvements. 
 I would also like to provide some color on the recent issuance of $500 million in Senior PIK Toggle Notes by Chinos Intermediate Holdings A, Inc., an indirect parent holding company of J. Crew group. The notes, issued subsequent to our third quarter on November 4, 2013, are senior unsecured obligations of the Issuer and mature in 2019. None of the Issuer's subsidiaries guarantee the notes and, as a result, the debt will not be recorded on the financial statements of J. Crew Group. Interest on the notes will be paid semi-annually and accrue at a rate of 7.75%, with respect to payments in cash or subject to certain conditions paid in kind at 8.5%. We intend to pay interest obligations on the notes in cash, with the funding made available by dividends from J. Crew Group. Net proceeds from the offering of approximately $490 million were used to fund a cash dividend and dividend equivalent compensation to certain equity and equity-award holders. 
 With that, I would now like to turn the call over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer portion of the call. 
 "
RY," 
   Royal Bank of Canada (RY) Q4 2013 Earnings Call December  5, 2013  8:30 AM ET 
 Operator 
 Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the RBC 2013 Fourth Quarter Results Conference Call. 
 I would now like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Karen McCarthy, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Ms. McCarthy. 
 Karen E. McCarthy 
 Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Presenting to you this morning are Gord Nixon, President and CEO; Dave McKay, Group Head, Personal and Commercial Banking; Morten Friis, Chief Risk Officer; and Janice Fukakusa, CAO and CFO. Following their comments, we will open the call for questions from analysts. 
 The call will be approximately 1 hour long and will end just before 9:30. [Operator Instructions] We'll be posting management's remarks on our website shortly after the call. 
 Joining us on the call: George Lewis, Wealth Management and Insurance; Doug McGregor, Capital Markets and Investor &amp; Treasury Services; Mark Standish, Capital Markets and Investor &amp; Treasury Services; Zabeen Hirji, Chief Human Resource Officer; and Mark Hughes, Deputy Chief Risk Officer. 
 As noted on Slide 2, our comments may contain forward-looking statements, which have all applying assumptions and have inherent risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. 
 I will now turn the call over to Gord Nixon. 
 Gordon M. Nixon 
 Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen in the press release issued early this morning, we announced that I will be retiring on August 1, 2014, after 13 years as CEO. You will also have read that Dave McKay will take on the role of President at our annual meeting on February 26 and will assume the role of President and CEO on August 1, 2014. 
 I can't tell you how delighted I am by this announcement. Many of you on the call know Dave well. In my opinion, he is one of the best retail bankers in the world and has been recognized as such and is universally supported and respected across our organization. In addition, his risk management and international corporate banking experience round him out nicely. Dave is a strong leader and innovator. He is client-focused and collaborative and, like me, believes our employees are the core of this great organization. 
 So let me turn to the obvious question, ""Why now?"" I think that the time is right for a transition. When I retire, I will have been CEO for over 13 years. I'm very proud of what we have accomplished but feel it is a great time to look to the future and build for the longer term. When we presented our 5-year strategy to the board this summer, it was clear to me that someone else should take the lead, as they would ultimately have the accountability for its performance. Dave just turned 50. He's at the right age and stage of his career to hopefully have a good 10-year run at leading this incredible organization. Dave has earned the opportunity, and he has the full support of our management team, which is fully committed and has never been stronger. 
 I'd just like to remind people that Bruce Ross will be joining our management team. He is one of the most highly seasoned global technology executives in the world, and he'll be joining in a few weeks as Group Head of Technology and Operations. And we're excited to have him onboard. 
 Over the past decade, our earnings and market shares have grown, both in Canada and internationally. We have a diversified business mix that continues to deliver sustained shareholder value, as was evidenced this quarter. We have a strong brand and culture. Our culture of inclusion makes us a great place to work, where all employees have the opportunity to succeed, and I am very proud of our employees who put their clients first and work together to bring out the best of RBC. 
 There is no question that this is an -- that as an organization, we are poised for success and continued strong performance. All of our businesses ended this year in good shape, with strong momentum and solid growth plans. So while I'm excited about continuing to lead the organization into 2014, I do believe that succession is one of my primary responsibilities, and I feel it is the right time to pass the baton to the next leader to take this great organization to the next level. 
 Before I conclude, I'd also like to thank Mark Standish for his contributions over the last 18 years. Mark has made a significant contribution in building the business globally, particularly in the U.S., through some of the most challenging market conditions in recent memory. Mark provided strong leadership in growing the RBC brand in New York, which has helped to attract and retain new talent and clients. Part of that successful brand building was a result of Mark's personal commitment to make a difference in the community through his volunteer board memberships and other activities. So on behalf of the board and my colleagues, we look forward to working with Mark over the next several months as he works with some of our trading businesses to facilitate transition under the changing regulatory regime in the U.S. 
 I'd also like to congratulate Doug McGregor, who is assuming the role as Chair and Chief Executive Officer of RBC Capital Markets and Group Head of both Capital Markets and Investor &amp; Treasury Services. Doug has helped Capital Markets and Investor &amp; Treasury Services grow in the face of economic and market uncertainties and an evolving regulatory environment, and I know that he will continue to be a positive force for change. 
 Doug has led the expansion and rebalancing of Capital Markets, where a greater portion of our earnings are now derived from corporate and investment banking, origination fees and client-based activities in our trading businesses, and this was evidenced again this quarter. His strong leadership, deep knowledge of the business and client focus will continue to serve RBC exceptionally well into the future. I'm looking forward to continuing to lead group executive over the next 8 months, and I will be looking forward to working closely with Dave to ensure a smooth transition. 
 So before I turn to our record results that we delivered, I'd like to ask Dave to say a few words, and I'm happy to come back to these issues during the Q&amp;A. Dave? 
 David I. McKay 
 Thank you for your kind words, Gord. Let me start by saying how honored I am by the confidence the board has placed in me to take over the stewardship of this incredible organization. It is an exciting time to be asked to take on the role of President and then CEO. As Gord said, we have tremendous momentum. Momentum that I think is created not only by the success of our diversified business mix, but also by our 79,000 employees who are focused on our clients and deliver on our brand and our values each and every day. 
 I'd like to take a minute to thank Gord for his ongoing support and guidance throughout my career. He's played a very important role in providing me with development opportunities. He set a high standard for me and all of the senior executives to follow. Let me close by saying that I'm excited not only about this new challenge, but also by the fact that I will continue to work with an excellent senior leadership team. 
 I believe that together we can continue to build on our great success to date. Thanks. 
 Gordon M. Nixon 
 Thank you, Dave. And now to the more important matter of the morning, which is our record results for 2013. As you've seen, we reported net income of $8.4 billion, which was up 12% from last year. We delivered a return on equity of over 19% and our all-in common equity Tier 1 ratio remains strong at 9.6%. We achieved all of our financial performance objectives for the year. 
 Our results were underpinned by the strength and diversity of our businesses, led by record performances in Personal &amp; Commercial Banking, Wealth Management and Capital Markets. During the year, we launched new products and partnerships, won new clients and gained market share in our key Canadian and global businesses, all while increasing efficiencies. 
 Looking at the fourth quarter, we delivered earnings of $2.1 billion, up 11% from last year. Our fourth quarter results were driven by strong growth in our corporate and investment banking businesses, solid volume growth in Canadian Banking, higher average fee-based client assets in Wealth Management and improved business performance in Investor &amp; Treasury Services. We did have a charge, as was reported a couple of weeks ago, in our Insurance segment, which had an impact. But we also had a favorable tax adjustment this quarter related to prior periods, both of which Janice will discuss in her remarks. 
 Turning to our business segments. I will provide an overview of our annual segment performance, and following, Morten and Janice will comment more fully on our fourth quarter results. Starting with Personal &amp; Commercial Banking, our Canadian Banking business delivered record earnings of over $4.4 billion, up 9% from last year, reflecting solid volume growth across all businesses, improved credit quality and our ongoing focus on efficiency and management activities. Our Canadian Banking fourth quarter earnings were $1.1 billion, up 7% from a year ago. 
 We closed our acquisition of Ally Canada back in February and completed the integration of this business this quarter. Overall, we are very pleased with Ally's performance, which has exceeded our objectives. The timing of this acquisition could not have been better. It not only gave us the leading market position in auto financing but enabled us to take advantage of growing market trends. 
 Across all other key product categories, we continue to be a market leader, with either #1 or #2 market share. Our results clearly reflect our ability to leverage our size and scale to take a disproportionate share of industry growth at, at least a 25% premium to the market over the last few years which, as you know, is our objective. 
 In personal financial services, we saw solid volume growth, reflecting the unparalleled size and scale of our multichannel distribution network, which allows us to reach more clients when and how they want. The breadth and quality of our product offering allowed us to grow faster than our peers, and we are also delivering innovative and differentiated products and services to capture a greater share of key high-growth client segments, such as retirees, business owners and newcomers to Canada, a key priority for us. In addition, RBC has a proven ability to cross-sell more effectively. We led the industry with close to 22% of our clients having at least 3 products or services with us, checking, investments and lending, compared to a peer average of 14%. This year, we were recognized for the second consecutive year as the Best Retail Bank in North America by Retail Banker International. 
 As well, our business financial services business was recently recognized as the Best Commercial Bank by World Finance. We have the leading commercial franchise with unparalleled industry specialization and the largest sales force in the industry. We continue to expand our sales force and strengthen our product and service offerings, including enhancing our mobile capabilities for business. 
 In cards and payment solutions, we have an extensive cards portfolio and grew both transaction volumes and loan balances this year. We pride ourselves on our long-standing relationships with our clients. They appreciate that we are constantly innovating and enhancing our cards portfolio, including entering into key partnerships this year with Target and WestJet. We are also at the forefront of emerging payments and mobile technologies, and in the last few months, we announced a number of innovations in this space, including the first cloud-based secure mobile payment solution in Canada. 
 While growing volumes in Canadian Banking is a priority, we are also committed to improving efficiency and productivity, particularly as we face a slower growth environment. For example, in early 2014, we will be launching a new mortgage origination system that automates and simplifies the end-to-end mortgage process to improve client response time. As you're aware, we've been working on this for quite some time. Our efficiency ratio of 44.5% leads the industry, and we expect to continue to drive this ratio to the low-40s over the medium term. 
 In the Caribbean, as we have discussed throughout the year, we continue to believe that the Caribbean remains an attractive region for RBC, and we are aggressively managing this business to drive improved performance, while in U.S. banking, we are focused on growing our cross-border business and serving the banking needs of our U.S. Wealth Management clients. 
 Turning to Wealth Management. We had record earnings of almost $900 million, up 18% last year, largely reflecting higher average fee-based clients and transaction volumes. We also generated strong earnings of $205 million in this quarter. While flat year-over-year, it was a result -- our underlying performance was very strong, but we were impacted by an unusual credit charge that Morton will discuss later on. Our client assets grew by 12% this year to reach over $1 trillion for the quarter. While the low rate environment persisted, our business capitalized on a moderate improvement in global and economic market conditions. 
 Starting with Global Asset Management. We are now a top 50 Global Asset Manager and the second-fastest [ph] growing asset manager in the world, having more than doubled our assets under management from 2007 to 2012, according to a global ranking published by Pension &amp; Investments and Towers Watson. In Canada, we continue to lead in the mutual fund market share and captured the largest share of long-term fund sales in the industry. In addition, our institutional asset management business experienced positive flows from both our North American and BlueBay teams and consistently ranked #1 for fund assets quarter-over-quarter. Our Global Asset Management business is highly profitable and a significant contributor to RBC Wealth Management's earnings. This business continues to be the focus of our acquisition efforts, and we look for complementary international acquisitions to add to global equity capabilities, particularly given our success with BlueBay. 
 Turning to the Canadian and U.S. and international Wealth Management businesses. RBC is the largest and most comprehensive wealth manager in Canada. We were recognized this year as the Best Private Bank in the country for the second consecutive year by Professional Wealth Management and the Bankers magazine. Overall, RBC has a strong and industry-leading high-net-worth market share of 19%, and we continue to extend this lead by offering superior advice, best-in-class solutions and broad experience. 
 We continue to shift towards a more fee-based model. And in the U.S., our average fee-based clients' assets are up 9% from last year, contributing to an increase in earnings for the region. Beyond North America, we continue to invest in establishing scalable foundations in key financial centers. 
 In Insurance, although the results were negatively impacted by the fourth quarter charge related to the proposed legislation in Canada affecting certain individual life insurance policies, this business contributed almost $600 million of earnings this year. Factoring out the charge, our fourth quarter earnings were very strong compared to the prior year. We are transforming the way we sell insurance, as we are going directly to consumers more than ever before, given our comprehensive product offering. We are selling more insurance through our lower-cost channels, such as our retail insurance stores, proprietary sales force, contact centers and online presence. 
 In Investor &amp; Treasury Services, our business performance continued to improve as we delivered higher revenue and benefited from our ongoing focus on efficiency management activities, generating annual earnings of over $340 million. Our fourth quarter earnings of $92 million were up 28% from the prior year. We are creating a specialist custody bank that provides excellence and asset servicing with an integrated funding and liquidity business for financial and other institutional investors worldwide. We're the leading Canadian custodian, with more than 40% market share of assets under administration. Our business is completed by offshore expertise, primarily based in Luxembourg, where we have the largest third-party asset service provider. 
 We are building revenue opportunities by leveraging RBC's strong reputation, brand, financial strength and cross-sell capabilities, opportunities we didn't have under our joint venture. I'm extremely excited about this business going forward. And for the third consecutive year in a row, we were voted the #1 overall custodian in the R&amp;M global custodian net survey. 
 Turning to Capital Markets. We had a record year, with earnings of $1.7 billion. We finished the year with fourth quarter earnings of over $470 million. These results highlight the successful execution of our strategy to rebalance this business towards an originate-and-distribute model. We continue to shift to more traditional corporate and investment banking activities and are repositioning our trading businesses to focus on origination to achieve greater earning flexibility. We had strong growth in our corporate and investment banking business, particularly in lending and loan syndication activities, primarily in the United States, as we remain focused on extending our loan book to establish new client relationships and deepening existing ones by offering a fuller suite of products. 
 This year, our global markets businesses were impacted by a changing market environment, particularly due to the uncertainty pertaining to the direction of the U.S. fiscal and monetary policies in the latter half of the year. We lowered our compensation to revenue ratio to 37.8%, which is down 200 basis points from 2012, driven by our focus on improving productivity relative to compensation. Geographically, we produced solid results in Canada, where we are clear market leader. We remain focused on execution in building long-term relationships, increasing market share with small- and medium-sized companies and leveraging our global capabilities. And we continue to win significant mandates. We are advising Shoppers Drug Mart on their $13.8 billion sale to Loblaw's and Hudson's Bay Company on their $2.9 billion purchase of Saks, ranking us #1 -- ranking us #2 globally in retail M&amp;A, as at October 31, according to Dealogic. 
 In the U.S., we are now generating over half of our Capital markets revenue globally, providing us both diversification and attractive growth opportunity, particularly as the U.S. economy improves. Recently, we have been involved in a number of high-profile U.S. deals, including the $49 billion offering of senior unsecured notes by Verizon, the financing of the $25 billion privatization of Dell and the $6 billion acquisition financing for Neiman Marcus. All 3 of these deals closed this quarter. 
 In the U.K. and Europe, we are selectively building our investment bank and continuously evaluating the performance of our business. We're also shifting from trading to more lending and origination, consistent with our North American strategy. While global capital markets continues to face regulatory reform, we believe we can continue to successfully adapt our business to this changing landscape. 
 As I mentioned earlier, we met all of our financial performance objectives for the year. Our strong capital position continues to provide us with the flexibility to find the optimal balance between investing in our business for long-term growth and returning capital to our shareholders. During the year, we raised our dividend twice for a combined increase of 12%, and we also repurchased 6.8 million of our common shares. We ended the year at the midpoint of our dividend payout range. 
 We are maintaining the same financial performance objectives for next year: diluted earnings per share growth of 7%-plus, return on equity of 18%-plus, strong capital ratios and a dividend payout ratio in the range of 40% to 50%. These key financial performance objectives help us measure our progress against medium-term objectives of maximizing total shareholder return by achieving top quartile performance. We generated strong total shareholder returns of 13% for both the 3- and 5-year periods. I would also highlight that in 2013, we generated a total shareholder return of 28%. 
 Our record results and accomplishments this year are in large part reflective of our strategic goals, as outlined on Page 6, which we have remained focused, consistent and build on our strength. These strategic goals drive our high-quality and sustainable earnings growth. While regulatory changes, prolonged low interest rates, market volatility and increased competition certainly have posed and will pose challenges, we also see great opportunities that are aligned with our view of global trends and build on our strengths. 
 We're committed to delivering the right strategy, business mix, culture and people to drive continued growth and take advantage of these opportunities; and our financial strength, diversified businesses and leading market share remain clear competitive advantages in today's environment. In closing, I am certainly pleased with our accomplishments this past year. We ended a record year, building on the strong momentum we had throughout 2013, and we believe this positions us very well going forward. 
 Before I turn the call over to Morten, as you would know, we announced back at the end of August that Morten will be retiring early next year after more than 30 years of service with RBC. Given this will be his last quarterly call, I wanted to take this opportunity to thank him for his exceptional contribution during his distinguished career at the bank. His strategic thought leadership, breadth of experience and deep understanding of the ever-evolving risk management landscape has made him an outstanding Chief Risk Officer. We're all extremely grateful. 
 So thank you for that, Morten. And with that, I turn it over to you. 
 Morten N. Friis 
 Thank you, Gordon. That's very kind. Maybe people are focused on other retirements than mine. 
 Turning to credit on Slide 8. We saw an uptick in provisions this quarter, overall -- but overall credit quality remained sound. Provisions for credit losses on impaired loans of $335 million, or 32 basis points, increased $68 million, or 6 basis points, from the prior quarter. With respect to gross impaired loans, while impairment formations have increased this quarter, gross impaired loans are down $50 million over the year, and our impairment level is lower than our Canadian peers. 
 Looking at credit performance in more detail. Turning to Slide 9. Provisions in Canadian Banking were $250 million, up $37 million over last quarter, or 4 basis points. At 29 basis points, this remains at the low end of our historical range. The increase in provisions primarily reflected higher impairment on our personal lending portfolio and higher impairments in our business portfolio, as we grew volumes in both businesses. Provisions in our credit card portfolio decreased quarter-over-quarter, reflecting fewer bankruptcies. Provisions on our residential mortgages remained low at 3 basis points, consistent with our historic performance. Gross impaired loans increased slightly over the last quarter, but remained within our historical range. 
 Turning to the Caribbean. Provisions on impaired loans were $26 million, up $13 million from the previous quarter, largely related to a couple of accounts. While credit quality in our Caribbean portfolio has been stabilizing, challenges are likely to persist in the near term until we see sustained improvements in the regional economic environment. 
 We incurred provisions of $42 million in Wealth Management this quarter related to a few accounts. As I mentioned last quarter, growing the credit book forms part of this segment's long-term growth strategy and provisions at moderate levels are an expected outcome of that business activity. We expect loan loss provisions within Wealth Management to show some degree of variability from quarter-to-quarter, but this quarter's provisions fall outside of our expected range. We remain comfortable with the segment's overall credit quality, given our strict credit adjudication standards and the strong creditworthiness of the client base. With respect to Capital Markets, provisions were $11 million, or 8 basis points, down $17 million, or 12 basis points, compared to last quarter. 
 Turning to market risk. In 2013, average value at risk was $44 million and average stress VaR was $95 million, up $17 million compared to last year. The increase in stress VaR largely reflects the fact that our trading portfolio is more heavily weighted towards mortgage-backed securities and high-grade credit-sensitive fixed income debt, whose price behavior was particularly volatile during the financial crisis of 2008-2009, which is the historical period used for stress VaR calculations. 
 During the fourth quarter, we had no days with net trading losses. In 2013, we had 7 days with net trading losses, down from 20 days in 2012. The annual number of days with net trading losses was down for a second consecutive year. 
 Before I conclude my remarks, I want to take this moment to thank you all for your questions over the years and to officially welcome my successor, Mark Hughes, and wish him luck. Mark has been with RBC since 1981 and has both a broad and deep experience with our organization, which will make him an excellent Chief Risk Officer. 
 With that, I'll turn the presentation over to Janice. 
 Janice R. Fukakusa 
 Thanks, Morten, and good morning. Turning to Slide 11. We had a solid fourth quarter with earnings of $2.1 billion, up $208 million or 11% over last year. Continuing our momentum, performance this quarter was underpinned by strong fundamentals. 
 I would note that while we had a relatively clean quarter, we had 2 items that largely offset each other. The first item is the $118 million after-tax charge in our Insurance segment discussed earlier. The second item is a favorable income tax adjustment of $124 million related to prior years. While this tax adjustment reduced our effective tax rate this quarter from 23% to 18%, we continue to expect our effective tax rate to be in the low 20% range going forward. Compared to the prior quarter, earnings were down $185 million, or 8%. 
 Moving on to capital. We completed our first year under Basel III with our capital ratios remaining strong and in excess of regulatory requirements. For 2013, our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 9.6%, largely driven by strong internal capital generation. This quarter, we also built our capital levels in anticipation of several notable regulatory and accounting changes scheduled to come into effect in the first quarter of 2014. As I mentioned on our last call, the first phase of the credit valuation adjustment, or CVA, is expected to negatively impact our common equity Tier 1 ratio by approximately 30 basis points. 
 Effective November 1, we adopted a new accounting standard related to pensions and other post-employment benefits, which is expected to negatively impact our ratio by approximately 10 basis points. As we transition to the new standard, we will be restating our financials next quarter, including an increase in pension expense of $70 million for 2012 and $125 million for 2013. Going forward, we anticipate a modest increase in pension expense. We will continue to prudently manage our capital levels going forward, given the evolving regulatory environment. 
 Let me now turn to the quarterly performance of our business segments on Slide 12. Personal &amp; Commercial Banking generated strong earnings of over $1 billion in the quarter, representing an increase of $47 million, or 5%, from last year, largely due to earnings growth of 7% in Canadian Banking, reflecting solid volume growth of 7%, which includes the contribution of our Ally Canada acquisition. Sequentially, earnings decreased $99 million, or 8%. Higher volume growth across all our Canadian Banking businesses was more than offset by higher PCL, a provision related to post-employment benefits and restructuring charges in the Caribbean and moderate spread compression. 
 Margins in Canadian Banking were down 7 basis points from last quarter, as the prior quarter was favorably impacted by fair value purchase accounting adjustments related to our acquisition of Ally Canada and the reversal of accounting volatility from the second quarter. Factoring out these impacts, margins were down 2 basis points, in line with our expectation of 1 to 2 basis points of sequential compression. Looking ahead, we expect margins to remain under pressure, given the continued low interest rate environment, slowing growth in consumer lending and competitive pricing pressures. 
 Our reported operating leverage and efficiency ratios this quarter were 0.2% and 44.8%, respectively, with growth in noninterest expense remaining well contained. I would remind you that expenses in the fourth quarter are often subject to a degree of seasonal elevation due to true-up of marketing and other discretionary spend. Going forward, we continue to manage the trajectory of expense growth against revenue growth and are adjusting the pace of our investments in response to a slower growth environment. 
 We remain committed to driving our efficiency ratio down to the low-40s over the medium term and are seeing good progress from a number of initiatives under way in Canadian Banking, including the launch of our new mortgage origination system early in 2014, as Gord mentioned. Also with the acquisition of Ally Canada now fully integrated, we believe we are on track to generate meaningful synergies, further contributing to steady improvements in our efficiency ratio, as well as generating positive operating leverage. 
 Turning to Wealth Management on Slide 13. We earned $205 million this quarter, relatively flat compared to last year, as higher average fee-based client assets resulting from net sales and capital appreciation were offset by higher PCL of $42 million on a few accounts, as discussed by Morten, and lower transaction volumes as we continued to shift our business towards more recurring fee-based revenue. Noninterest expense also increased this quarter compared to last year, reflecting higher variable compensation, driven by higher commissionable revenue, as well as increased staff levels and infrastructure investments, as we support the growth of our wealth and asset management businesses. Compared to the prior quarter, earnings were down $31 million, or 13%, driven by higher PCL. 
 Moving to Insurance on Slide 14. Net income of 170 -- $107 million was down $87 million, or 45%, compared to last year and down $53 million compared to last quarter, primarily due to the previously disclosed charge of $118 million after tax discussed previously. Let me take a few moments to explain the charge more fully. Under Canadian IFRS, the present value of the expected profit for a life policy is recognized at the time the policy is sold. Subsequent to initial recognition, changes in assumptions as a result of updated experience or new regulations impacting these life insurance policies are recognized in net income when the changes are made. 
 While the legislation remains proposed, from an accounting perspective, we consider the measures to be substantively enacted. Therefore, as a result of the legislative changes, the current expected profit on these policies is lower than what we initially expected. The charge is based on our assumption that we expect a significant portion of affected clients to select one of the revised offerings we are offering, and we will update the charge, if necessary, to reflect any changes in policyholder experience or regulations. Excluding this charge, net income increased $31 million, or 16%, compared to last year and $65 million, or 41%, compared to last quarter, reflecting favorable actuarial adjustments and a gain on the sale of our Canadian travel agency insurance business. 
 Turning to Slide 15. Investor &amp; Treasury Services earned $92 million, up $20 million, or 28%, from last year, reflecting improved business performance in Investor Services and continued benefits from our ongoing efficiency management activities. Compared to the prior quarter, earnings were down $12 million, or 12%, as the prior quarter has seasonally higher securities lending fees. 
 Turning to Capital Markets on Slide 16. We had strong earnings of $472 million, up $62 million, or 15%, from last year. This reflects strong growth in our corporate and investment banking businesses, primarily loan syndication and lending activities in the U.S., and the favorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. We also had lower PCL, due largely to a provision taken in the prior year on a single account, which also contributed to the increase. This impact was offset in part by higher litigation provisions and related legal costs. Compared to last quarter, net income was up $84 million, or 22%, largely driven by strong growth in loan syndication activities across all geographies and higher debt origination, mainly in the U.S. 
 Our results this quarter highlight our strong momentum in corporate and investment banking, and our performance was positively impacted by a number of large notable transactions that Gord highlighted, which closed at the end of the quarter. Looking ahead, we have a strong deal, pipeline, which continues to grow both in Canada and the U.S. 
 To wrap up, we are very pleased with our solid performance this quarter. We have a diverse and strong portfolio of businesses. And as Gord noted, we believe we remain well positioned to continue delivering sustainable earnings growth. 
 At this point, I'll turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&amp;A. Operator? 
 "
CSUN," 
   China Sunergy Co. Ltd. (CSUN) Q3 2013 Results Earnings Call December  5, 2013  8:00 AM ET 
 Operator 
 Welcome to China Sunergy’s Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. 
 Mr. Michael Tieu from Asia Bridge Capital, you may begin your conference. 
 Michael Tieu 
 Thank you, Operator. And welcome to China Sunergy third quarter 2013 earnings conference call. For this call, we have posted a presentation on our website and during today’s discussion we will be closely following and referring to this presentation. With us today are China Sunergy’s CEO, Mr. Stephen Cai; CFO, Mr. Yongfei Chen; and CTO, Dr. Jianhua Zhao. 
 Today before the market opened, the company issued a press release announcing our third quarter 2013 financial results and our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year of 2013. This press release is also available on the Investors Section of our website at www.csun-solar.com. 
 To start, Stephen will present an overview of our third quarter results and a quick review of important developments at CSUN and the solar industry. Then, CFO, Mr. Chen will explain our financial results in more detail. Following that, CTO, Dr. Jianhua Zhao will provide a technology update, and then Stephen will close with guidance. Afterwards, they will all be available to take your questions. 
 Before I turn the call over to Stephen, I would like to remind our listeners that management’s prepared remarks include forward-looking statements made under the Safe Harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. 
 Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties and as such, our results may be materially different from the views expressed today. A number of potential risks and uncertainties are outlined in our public filings with the SEC. 
 China Sunergy does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required under applicable law. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. 
 Now, I’d like to turn the call over to CEO, Mr. Stephen Cai. Stephen? 
 Stephen Cai 
 Thank you, Michael. Thank you all for joining today’s conference call. I am glad to speak with you again today and as we have noted with you in our last call several weeks ago, we observe that China’s domestic banks drastically reduced the credit facilities to solar companies from July to October of this year, which we believe is due to their concerns stemming from the uncertainties regarding the EU anti-dumping case. 
 Consequently, our working capital during the third quarter was severely constraint and as we were able -- unable to purchase adequate raw materials to meet our production requirement. Our shipment volume decreased sequentially. 
 Recognizing this near-term tough credit environment, we proactively took more OEM arrangements during the third quarter in order to keep our production lines running and avoid potentially costly production shutdown. 
 Although, some of the OEM business arrangements may sometimes yield an active profit margins, we believe our [core decisive] actions, deceivable actions during the quarter helped us to sustain critical mass and remained in a healthy position to recapture shipment growth when the situation eventually improve. 
 The good news is, the situation has improved, this November, we are thrilled to witness local banks return confidence and a support, boosted by recent positive policies and incentives for the solar industry enacted by China's central and provincial governments. 
 The virtually frozen credit environment in China has slowed in the fourth quarter and we are once again about to secure additional working capital for operations and other initiatives. Now, let’s provide you with a more detailed review of our operations during the third quarter of 2013. 
 As summarized on slide four, in third quarter, we shipped total of 113 megawatts, roughly in line with our previous expectation of 110 megawatts. Embedded in the total shipments was approximately 22 megawatts of OEM arrangements. 
 Blended average ASP for modules in the third quarter was $0.62 per watt, which was $0.01 lower than in the previous quarter. The lower module ASP was primarily due to more sales to lower priced regions during the quarter. Accordingly, gross margin for the quarter decreased to 3% and a non-GAAP gross margin was about 4.6% in line with our guidance. 
 Please turn to Slide 4 -- sorry Slide 5 for our revenue breakdown by geography. As you know, we have been working actively on further diversifying our geographic mix. And during the third quarter, we effectively lowered our reliance on European sales. 
 Asia filled by favorable government policy and plans was a highlight during the quarter and we were successful in further penetrating this market with higher shipments to China, India and Japan. This quarter, Asia for the first time surpassed Europe and became our largest market with revenue contribution of more than 63% of our total revenue, compared with less than 20% in the previous quarter. 
 Within Asia, India and China became the largest market, accounting for 24% and 23% of the quarter total revenue, followed by Japan at 16%, which more than doubled compared with last quarter. As anticipated, the demand in the year-over decrease with the revenue contribution decreasing to 33% as European customer that have the stockpiled before August of settlement reduced purchases. 
 Looking ahead, we aim to further capture the market opportunities in fast-growing market and we view China, Japan and India as important markets for CSUN for the quarters ahead. China solar market has outperformed thus far into 2013. As China has very attractive project economics that are supported by not only central government incentive but also feed-in-tariffs and local tax incentives to promote solar growth. 
 Next, please turn to Slide 6 for update on our Turkey manufacturing plant. Our top priority for the Turkey plant is to continue ramping up the production at a capacity utilization in order to enhance efficiency and profitability. During the third quarter, our shipments are from Turkey more than tripled to 15 megawatts from 4 megawatts in the previous quarter. 
 Our monthly module production volume increased more than five folds to 11 megawatts from only 2 megawatts in the second quarter. In addition, our cell production line in Turkey also started to test around this October and then we plan to use the cells for module production going forward. 
 In addition, during the third quarter, our Turkey plant completed full inspection and received certifications from TUV. As we continue to secure sales and the backlog from the European customers, we expected to further expand sales and eventually to fulfill all orders from Europe and the surrounding markets from our Turkey plant. 
 By the end of this third quarter, we have received orders totaling approximately 30 megawatt. Our Turkey-made module has been well accepted and the first project deploying this module has been installed, being a Turkish customer on top of the Asfa school in Istanbul and it will be connected into the grid zone. 
 Originally, we have initiated the local financing and secured initial cash loan and credit lines from local banks in Turkey. Although these initial loans and credit lines are for small amounts. They help to establish corporation and relationship with the local banks for future financing activities. 
 Now let’s turn to Slide 7 for a review of the converging cost. This quarter converging cost of sales and modules manufactured were at $0.15 and $0.22 per watt respectively, compared with $0.15 and $0.20 in the previous quarter. As discussed in our last call with you, our Turkey plant just managed production in May and average conversion cost of the module. They are still higher than that at our China plants. 
 During the third quarter, as we ramp up production, the average monthly module production volume as the Turkey plant increased more than fivefolds. And accordingly, due to the higher production volume from the Turkey plant, the weightage average conversion cost of the module increased by $0.02 compared with previous quarter. 
 Last, a quick update on downstream project. I’m glad that earlier this month, we closed our first PV project sale, the 5 megawatt U.K. project. This marks the first sale transaction for the CSUN self developed downstream project and highlights our pioneering spirits as we are the first Chinese developer to fully complete downstream project last cycle, having invested, developed, construct, operated and now solar ground-based solar PV project in the Europe, U.K. 
 The second of 5 megawatt project in the U.K. has qualified for feed-in tariffs and is scheduled to be connected to grid by the end of this year. In China, the construction of the 22 megawatt commercial rooftop project for the Golden Sun project is also on schedule and on budget. 
 In summary, despite facing a tough credit environment, we were able to quickly adjust our business through proactive sales mix of the modules and the OEM, while continue to make further progress in our objectives. 
 Looking forward, I believe China Sunergy is progressively getting back to on track. We have secured additional working capital and further enhanced operations through high production efficiency and more disciplined cost and expense control. 
 We are seeing the solar market continued positive momentum with the stable pricing environment. As such, I'm optimistic that China Sunergy will capture additional market opportunity and again build operational scale. 
 Now, I will like to turn the call over to Yongfei Chen, our CFO to go through the numbers in detail. 
 Yongfei Chen 
 Thank you, Stephen. In light of the credit trends given in the third quarter, our top priority for the management team was to maximize available working capital, while also finding ways to keep our production lines running and low expenses. 
 Accordingly, we continually communicated to local banks to extend our loans. We took our long OEM business and we comprehensively controlled operating expenses. A good news as Stephen had mentioned is that the tough credit environment in China has eased, and we have been able to renew more than 60% of due loans by the end of the third quarter. 
 And based on our current communication with local banks, we are confident to rollover nearly all due loans by the end of December. I’m glad that we now have sufficient working capital and we are confident in our ability to return to normal operational scale and continue to go past to improve profitability. 
 Now, let’s turn to Slide 8 of the PowerPoint presentation for more details on financials. In the third quarter of 2013, we shipped a total of 112.7 megawatts, a decrease of 10.8% of the second quarter of 2013. 
 Included in total shipment, OEM arrangements was about 22 megawatts, compared with 25 megawatts in the previous quarter. Our revenue this quarter was $57.1 million from 20.6% sequentially, due to a combination of lower shipment volume and ASP. Our module ASP decreased $0.01 sequentially to $0.52, primarily due to increased shipments to lower-priced regions, including India and China. 
 Most importantly, gross profit decreased to $1.7 million from $6.7 million in the previous quarter, the decrease in gross profit was mainly due to higher OEM shipments, increased inventory provision, higher conversion cost and as well as low ASP. 
 During the quarter, we had an inventory write-down of $0.9 million compared with only $12,000 in the previous quarter. Overall, gross margin for the quarter was 3%, compared with 9.3% a quarter ago. Excluding inventory provision, non-GAAP gross profit was 4.6%. 
 During the quarter, general expenses was $8.4 million compared with $5.1 million in the previous quarter. The general expenses during the quarter included a bad debt provision of $1.3 million, compared with our reversal of bad debt provision of $2 million in the previous quarter. 
 On a non-GAAP basis, general expenses remained unchanged at $7.1 million. And we will continue to tightly control OpEx, diligently collect bad debts and optimize headcount. 
 Sales and marketing expense was $4.8 million, a slight increase from $4.6 million in the previous quarter. Net interest expense increased to $7.1 million compared with $5.1 million a quarter ago, mainly due to more interest expense on discounted note receivables as we pre-cashed some notes. 
 Other income totaled $3.7 million, mainly from exchange gains during the quarter. Tax benefit was $1.2 million compared with tax expense of $1.4 million in the previous quarter. 
 All in all, net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders was $13.2 million and net loss per ADS was $0.99 in the third quarter. Non-GAAP net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders was $11 million and net loss per ADS was $0.83. 
 Going into our balance sheet items on slide nine, as working capital improved later in the quarter. We purchased some more raw materials in preparation for the first quarter production requirements. 
 Accordingly, total inventory level in the third quarter increased to $65.6 million from $46.5 million in the previous quarter. Account receivables decreased to $67.6 million at the end of third quarter, reflecting the decreased sales during the quarter. 
 CapEx was $3.4 million this quarter as we started to upgrade several of our current cell and module production lines. And we anticipate spending another $1 million to $3 million in the first quarter to complete these upgrades. 
 This quarter operating cash inflow was $16.4 million, compared with $6.3 million in the previous quarter, primarily driven by low account receivables, higher advances from customers and higher accounts payables. 
 However, during the quarter, we repaid due bank loans and purchased some more raw materials and as such October cash balance decreased slightly to $260 million from $220 million. 
 Let me now turn the call over to Dr. Zhao to provide you with our technology updates and guidance. 
 Dr. Jianhua Zhao 
 Thank you, Mr. Chen and Stephen, and welcome everyone to our call. I am glad to speak with you again for our update on our recent technology achievements. As displayed on slide 10, during the third quarter both the average efficiency of our multi-cells and mono-cells continue to achieve meaningful improvement over the previous quarter. 
 The average efficiency of our high performance multi-cells called Waratah reached a new record average efficiency of 17.7%, compared with 17.6% a quarter ago. We remained confident to achieve our 2013 year-end target of 17.8%. 
 During the third quarter, average QSAR II cell efficiency reached 19.2% and the average module power output was up to 265 watts, among the highest in the field. In addition, our upgraded QSAR II cell lines started mass production in September. 
 Since then our QSAR II cell efficiency has made outstanding improvement with daily production efficiency reaching 19.26% in September and 19.34% in October. We are confident to achieve the efficiency rate of 19.5% by the end of 2013. This November, we are also further upgrading our QSAR II production lines, which we believe will expand our production capacity. 
 Modules assembled with our QSAR II cells easily passed the TUV standard test of exposure to minus 1000 volt for 48 hours at 85 degree Celsius and 85% humidity. Even better, our module has already passed TUV’s minus 1,500 volt test and (inaudible) water fume test, which are the highest PID test condition. These achievements clearly demonstrate our QSAR II cells excellent PID 3 feature. 
 I am honored to say with the persistent efforts of our entire R&amp;D team the advanced leading technology of our product has been proven and well recognized. In addition to our QSAR II modules had impact the highest PID Test, our new generation of high efficiency monocrystalline silicon cells has reached 20.26% conversion efficiency in our R&amp;D line which has recently received the certification from Fraunhofer ISE. 
 The new record of 20.26% was confluent at the leading level among all PV enterprises in China and surpassed the benchmark of 20% set by the eight development guidelines issued by the state council for China 's PV industry in July 2013. 
 Lastly, as we communicated in our last call in November, we launched Super Black Module following initial customized order for 60 kilowatt rooftop project in Hawaii. With its anti-glare feature, the Super Black Module reduces reflection and has performed excellently in low sunlight conditions. 
 The Super Black module also recently received the TUV Certification and we will continue our efforts to fulfill unique customer requirements. As always, we are confident and are committed to bring additional innovations as well as reliable and affordable solar products to the world. 
 Let me return the call to Stephen to provide our highlights. Stephen? 
 Stephen Cai 
 Thank you, Dr. Zhao. To summarize, the third quarter was obviously unique this year as our production and our sales plan were impacted by the constrained working capital. However, we are pleased that, we were able to quickly adjust our business mix. 
 We are also pleased to see that easing of the credit by China Banks and we have secured additional working capital and further enhanced operations. Furthermore, we are encouraged to buy continue positive momentum in the solar market. And as such, we are optimistic about China Sunergy’s prospects in the near future. 
 For the fourth quarter of 2013, reflecting our improved working capital and stronger than expected OEM shipments, we estimate that total shipment will be in the range of 158 megawatt to 168 megawatt including approximately 40 megawatts of the solar module processed under OEM arrangement. 
 Gross margin for the first quarter of 2013 is expected to be mid single digit. Accordingly for the full year 2013, we raised total shipments estimates to range between 500 megawatts to 510 megawatts from the previous range of 440 megawatts to 480 megawatts. 
 At this time, I’d like to take your questions. If you have additional questions after this call, please do contact us afterwards. Operator, you may begin with the first question.

   ReneSola (SOL) Q3 2013 Earnings Call December  5, 2013  8:00 AM ET 
 Operator 
 Hello, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by for ReneSola Limited's Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host for today, Ms. Laura Chen, ReneSola Investor Relations Director. Please proceed, Ms. Chen. 
 Laura Chen 
 Hello, everyone, and welcome to ReneSola's third quarter earnings conference call. ReneSola's earnings results were released earlier today and are available on the company's website, as well as on Newswire services. You can follow along with today's call by downloading a short presentation available on the company's website at www.renesola.com. 
 On the call today are Mr. Xianshou Li, our Chief Executive Officer; Mr. Henry Wang, our Chief Financial Officer and myself. I will discuss ReneSola's business highlights, and Mr. Wang will go through the financials and guidance. All of us will be available to answer your questions during the Q&amp;A session. 
 Before we continue, please note that today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements made under the Safe Harbor provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties. As such, the company's results may be materially different from the views expressed today. Further information regarding these and other risks and uncertainties is included in the company's annual report on Form 20-F and other documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. ReneSola does not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements except for -- except as required under applicable law. Please note that unless otherwise stated, all figures mentioned during this conference call are in U.S. dollars. 
 I should now begin with our business highlights from this quarter. Our results from Q3 marked the second consecutive quarter of record shipments and revenue. We exceeded guidance in delivering total shipments of 851 megawatts and expanded our gross margin to over 8%. These returns were driven by growth in overall demand for our modules as well as expansion in our module shipment volume to market with comparatively higher average selling prices. 
 We also expanded our global OEM module capacity in the third quarter after first implementing our OEM strategy at the end of last year. Our OEM module capacity is currently 950 megawatts on top of our internal module capacity of 1.2 gigawatts. Our OEM strategy enables us to grow our top line revenue and market share in our target market, while minimizing capital expenditures. It also provides a number of distinct advantages, including the avoidance of price loss, volume limits and anti-dumping tariffs in markets like the EU. We've been actively building OEM partnerships around the world and currently have OEM capacity in Poland, South Africa, South Korea, Malaysia and Turkey. We expect to expand our OEM capacity to more markets, including Japan. 
 Our globalization strategy also lies in our international sales distribution network. Currently, we have 3 sales offices and 8 warehouses in U.S. We also have sales offices across other regions, including Europe, Asia and Australia. We've been trying to penetrate into emerging markets, and our efforts are fruiting. More sales distribution offices are in set-up process in existing markets and new markets like South America. With the lease, our globalization strategy, including global OEM and global sales, will position us for sustainable long-term growth. 
 Building on our technological innovations, we are continuing to invest in R&amp;D to improve the performance and cost effectiveness of our modules. In addition, certification for our newer products, such as our micro-inverter, string inverter and storage system is now complete across most of our target markets. As such, these products are now available for order. 
 While competition in the solar market remains fierce, we're confident that our ability to innovate and enhance our brand image globally will drive our long-term growth. 
 I will now start reviewing our shipments. Total solar product shipments in this quarter were 851 megawatts, an increase of 0.2% from -- our module shipments increased 6.6% quarter-over-quarter to a record high of 462.9 megawatts, while our wafer shipments decreased 6.5% quarter-over-quarter to 388.1 megawatts. This reflects our focus on growing sales from our module business, while shifting from selling the wafers externally to using them internally for module production. Moreover, we grew our module sales across a number of key markets in the third quarter, particularly in the United States. 
 Our module ASPs continue to increase in the third quarter from $0.63 to $0.66 per watt, while wafer ASPs decreased slightly from $0.23 to $0.22 per watt. The 6% increase in module ASPs and 6.6% increase in module shipments drove top line growth of 11.1%. In the third quarter, we achieved almost balanced shipments across 3 major global markets, namely U.S., Europe and Asia Pacific. 
 Our Q3 shipments data highlights our success in expanding shipment volumes to more profitable markets. We shipped 143 megawatts to United States, a quarter-over-quarter increase of over 150%. For Japan, another one of our priority markets, we shipped 23 megawatts this quarter, up from 10 megawatts in Q2. We also shipped 180 megawatts to Europe. 
 Our ability to penetrate foreign markets is based on our world-class products and leading technology, along with the effectiveness of our international sales and the marketing teams in building our global brand. We expect that as market conditions stabilize and our global sales diversify, our shipment volumes will continue to rise. 
 I will now review our R&amp;D developments. We continue to invest in R&amp;D in the third quarter to support innovation in our technology, products and in manufacturing processes. Upon launching, we believe our Virtus II module product line became highly successful in the U.S. domestic PV market because of its outstanding performance, specifically in low light conditions and best in class temperature coefficients of minus 0.4% per degree Celsius. We believe we outperformed our competition in terms of power output as our 60 cell and 72 cell lines are generally about 5 watts ahead of our competitors offering greater power density. 
 In the third quarter, we obtained more certification for Replus micro-inverters and string converters across our target markets and are now preparing to market these products extensively. 
 In addition, the monitoring system, the Replus inverters, is now online. Our grid-tied and off-grid storage systems received numerous certifications, including CE, SAA and TUV in this quarter. Our 70 models of Euro-line LED products received SAA and C-TICK certificates and 9 models of our U.S. line products received UL and CUL certificates, all entering into marketing process. Moreover, our tile-roof and pitched-roof systems received Australia and TUV certification. All of these products are now available for order. 
 I will now turn the call over to Henry, who will discuss our financial results in more detail. 
 Henry Wang 
 Thanks, Laura. Hello, everyone. I will explore our financials [indiscernible]. 
 In the third quarter, we achieved record strength and a 11.1% revenue growth. We made our target for gross margin and then realized an increase in gross profit of close to 20%. We did, however, incur significant operating loss in this quarter due to noncash impairment charge of USD 202.8 million. The impairment charge [indiscernible] a write-down of Phase 1 production facility for our polysilicon factory, which I will discuss later. 
 I will now review details of our financial results of this quarter. Net revenues were $319.3 million, which exceeded our guidance and represents a sequential increase of 11.1% from $377.4 million, mainly due to an increase in demand for our solar module across a number of geographic regions, particularly in the United States. 
 Gross profit was $34.1 million compared to a gross profit of $27.4 million in the second quarter, primarily due to an increase in the average selling prices of solar modules from $0.63 per watt to $0.66 per watt, along with an increase in module shipments. 
 Gross margin was 8.1% compared to a gross margin of 7.3% in the second quarter. Operating loss was USD 180.3 million. Total operating expenses were $214.3 million compared to a $44 million in the second quarter. The sequential increase in operating expenses was primarily due to an impairment charge of $202.8 million, including a $194.7 million impairment charge on long-lived assets associated with the Phase I facility of our polysilicon plant. 
 
 In the quarter, we also recognized a gain of $34.7 million on the forfeiture by a customer of a deposit who received it in connection with a long-term supply contract, which offset a portion of the increase in operating expenses. 
 Operating expenses represented 51.1% of total revenues, including -- excluding the noncash impairment charge. And at the nonrecurring gain, operating expenses would have been $46.2 million, which represents 11% of total revenues compared to 11.7% in the second quarter. 
 Operating margin was negative 43%. Excluding the noncash impairment charge and the nonrecurring gain, the operating loss would have been $0.2 million, representing operating margin of negative 2.9% compared to operating margin of negative 4.4% in the same quarter. 
 Net loss attributable to holders of ordinary shares were $200.3 million. This represents basic and diluted loss per share of $1.12, and basic and the diluted loss per ADS of $2.23. 
 I will now provide an update on our cash and the debt position. As of September 30, 2013, we have debt of $831.2 million, excluding $111.6 million in convertible notes. Total bank borrowings decreased by $78.7 million sequentially as of the end of the second quarter. 
 Our net cash position, including cash and cash equivalents, plus restricted cash, was $438.5 million as of the end of the third quarter, $32.7 million increased from $405.8 million as of the end of the same quarter. 
 Lastly, our net cash flow from operating activities was $79.6 million compared to $65.5 million in the second quarter. 
 I will now provide you an update on our polysilicon factory. In the second quarter, we recognized the $202.8 million noncash impairment charge, including $194.7 million associated with the long-lived assets of our Phase I Sichuan polysilicon factory. The impairment charge was recognized as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeding the fair value of the idled assets. 
 In October 2012, we began the process of upgrading the Phase I factory and the integrating the operations with those of Phase II in an effort to realize production efficiencies and to reduce the cost to reduce polysilicon utilizing the Phase I production line. From July to September this year, we conducted trial productions of the integrated production line of Phase I and Phase II. At the end of September 2013, management concluded that our efforts to sufficiently reduce the cost of production compared to the prevailing market price of polysilicon were not successful. 
 After conducting a further internal assessment, management determined that it was no longer feasible to operate the Phase I facility without a loss and to recognize the impairment charge accordingly. Production at the Phase I facility was permanently discontinued in October 2013. The fair value of the idled assets used to determine the impairment charge was then determined by -- determined with the assistance of an independent professional third party appraiser and completed in November this year. 
 We expect to have an annual polysilicon manufacturing capacity of 6,000 metric tons after the permanent discontinuation of the Phase I facility. We believe that the decrease of internal supply of polysilicon can be offset through the purchasing from the external supplies at a market price. We also expect to operate the remaining production line of the Phase II facility in the full production and benefit from the lower power consumption and depreciating -- depreciation going forward as a result of the discontinuation of the Phase I facility to be able to keeping the production cost or below its target level, which would make our in-house production cost efficient based on the market price of polysilicon. Therefore, we expect to see improved results from our Sichuan polysilicon facility, which will enhance our gross margin going forward. 
 Now, please turn to our guidance. For the fourth quarter of this year, we expect total module shipments to be in the range of 490 megawatts to 510 megawatts and overall gross margin to be in the range of 9% to 11%. 
 For the full year 2013, we expect the total solar wafer and module shipments to be in the range of 3 gigawatts to 3.1 gigawatts with solar module shipments expected to be in the range of 1.7 gigawatts to 1.75 gigawatts. 
 We will now open the line for questions. Operator, please.

   Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CM) Q4 2013 Earnings Call December  5, 2013  7:30 AM ET 
 Operator 
 Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the CIBC Quarterly Results Conference Call. Please be advised that the meeting is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I will now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Geoff Weiss. Please go ahead, Mr. Weiss. 
 Geoffrey Weiss 
 Good morning, and thank you for joining us. This morning, CIBC senior executives will review CIBC's Q4 and fiscal 2013 results that were released earlier today. The documents referenced on this call, including CIBC's Q4 news release, investor presentation and financial supplement, as well as CIBC's 2013 financial statements and MD&amp;A can all be found on our website at www.cibc.com. In addition, an archive of this audio webcast will be available on our website later today, along with CIBC's full 2013 annual report, which was released earlier this morning with our results. 
 This morning's agenda will include opening remarks from Gerry McCaughey, CIBC's President and Chief Executive Officer; Kevin Glass, our Chief Financial Officer, will follow with the financial review; and Laura Dottori-Attanasio, our Chief Risk Officer, will close the formal remarks with a risk management update. After the presentations, there will be a question-and-answer period that will conclude by 8:30 a.m. Also with us for the question-and-answer period are CIBC's business leaders, including Victor Dodig, Richard Nesbitt and David Williamson, as well as other senior officers. 
 Before we begin, let me remind you that any individual speaking on behalf of CIBC on today's call may make forward-looking statements that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. These statements may include material factors or assumptions that could cause CIBC's actual results in future periods to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the note about forward-looking statements in today's press release. 
 With that, let me now turn the meeting over to Gerry. 
 Gerald T. McCaughey 
 Thank you, Geoff, and good morning, everyone. May I begin by reminding you that my comments may contain forward-looking statements. 
 In 2013, we achieved strong fiscal year earnings and generated good returns for our shareholders. This morning, CIBC reported 2013 net income of $3.4 billion and earnings per share of $8.23. On an adjusted basis, net income was $3.6 billion, up 7% over 2012; and earnings per share was $8.78, an increase of 9% over 2012, which is in line with our 5% to 10% medium-term target. CIBC's adjusted return on equity was 22.3%. 
 Throughout our year, we advanced our focus on our clients by providing greater choice and convenience. Our capital base remains strong while we continue to invest in strategic growth and return capital to our shareholders. At the end of fiscal 2013, our Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio was 9.4%. 
 During the year, CIBC increased common dividends to shareholders and renewed a normal course issuer bid to repurchase approximately 2% of shares outstanding. In fiscal 2013, CIBC returned approximately 60% of capital generated by earnings to shareholders while maintaining capital ratios that are among the highest in the industry. 
 Now turning to our business results. In 2013, Retail and Business Banking reported adjusted net income of $2.5 billion compared to $2.3 billion in the prior year. Retail and Business Banking continued to make strategic investment in areas that are enhancing the relationships we have and providing greater choice and convenience. 
 We launched the enhanced CIBC Aventura Travel Rewards program. CIBC also retained the Aerogold Visa credit card accounts held by clients with broader banking relationships with CIBC under the terms of a tri-party agreement with Aimia and TD. Earlier today, we announced a multi-year partnership which establishes CIBC as the GTAA's exclusive financial services provider in Toronto -- at Toronto Pearson International Airport. 
 We also focused our priorities on enhancing our sales and service capabilities to make it easier for our employees to support our clients and to acquire and retain clients. We launched the CIBC Banking Bundle offer to make it easier for our clients to bank with us and reward them for doing so. We were the first bank to invest in mobile innovation and currently have more than 1 million active clients who are now using our award-winning mobile banking app to perform many of their everyday banking transactions. 
 Just last week, we launched our latest innovation eDeposit, which allows our personal and small business clients to deposit their checks by simply taking a photo of their check on their mobile device, as well as the ongoing conversion of our FirstLine clients into CIBC-branded mortgages continues to exceed targets and supports our focus on client retention by introducing these clients to the benefits of a broader banking relationship with CIBC. Over the next 12 months, we will continue to invest in our front line sales and service capabilities to create deeper, more profitable relationships with our clients and leverage our multi-channel strategy. David Williamson is here this morning to answer questions about Retail and Business Banking. 
 Turning to Wealth Management. 2013 adjusted earnings were $392 million, up 29% from the prior year. Results were driven by our strong retail brokerage franchise and record net sales and long-term mutual funds. During the year, we were successful in attracting and deepening our client relationships with new product offerings. For example, CIBC's Investor's Edge was the first major Canadian bank-owned online brokerage to offer no-fee self-directed RESPs. Looking forward, our goal is to build Wealth Management's contribution to banks from the current 11% to more than 15%. We expect to accomplish this through organic growth initiatives, as well as acquisitions. 
 Our Q2 2013 acquisition of Atlantic Trust, a U.S. private wealth management firm, is on track to close in early fiscal '14. This will advance our North American growth strategy by establishing a footprint in the U.S. private wealth management market. Given the size and attractive characteristics of the U.S. wealth management markets, we will continue to look for acquisition opportunities as this market consolidates in the areas of asset management, private wealth and private banking. Victor Dodig is here this morning to answer questions about Wealth Management. 
 In Wholesale Banking, 2013 adjusted earnings of $834 million were up 23% compared to the prior year. Throughout the year, we executed on our client-focused strategy in key industries, including energy, global mining and infrastructure and North American commercial real estate. We continued to add value to our clients by helping them grow globally through expanded lending and advisory capabilities, as well as an expanded suite of capital markets products, particularly in the areas of foreign exchange, fixed income and commodities in key regions. 
 During the year, we were ranked #1 in Canadian equity trading based on volume and value and number of trades according to the TSX and ATS market share report. And we also ranked #1 by volume and by deal count in Canadian dollar denominated debt for governments in Canada according to Thomson Reuters True Economics. In loan syndication, we were ranked #1 by number of deals and #2 by value of deals led in 2013. Looking forward, we believe that our strategy of providing full service wholesale banking for our clients wherever they do business will provide us with quality, consistent returns over the long term. 
 In the Caribbean, where CIBC offers market-leading financial services in 17 countries, with over USD 11 billion in assets, our goal is to return to historic profitability through leveraging and mirroring CIBC's strength, cross-selling to deepen client relationships and optimizing our business model and mix. Richard Nesbitt is here this morning to answer questions about Wholesale Banking and our Caribbean operations. 
 In summary, our strong performance in 2013 reflects the successful execution of our client-focused strategy. Our outlook for 2014 is one of cautious optimism. The forecast for an improving economic and business environment is encouraging, somewhat offsetting a moderating -- an expected moderation in consumer lending volumes, as well as a cooling of the Canadian housing market. 
 Before I return -- before I turn the meeting over to Kevin Glass to review our Q4 2013 results, on behalf of the senior executive team and our board, I would like to take this opportunity to thank our shareholders for their continued support and to thank all of CIBC's 43,000 employees for their ongoing dedication to serving our 11 million clients. 
 With that, now let me turn the call over to Kevin. 
 Kevin A. Glass 
 Thanks, Gerry. My presentation will refer to the slides that are posted on our website, starting with Slide 7, which is a summary of results for the quarter. So we're very pleased with our strong fourth quarter results and the solid contribution from all of our business lines. 
 Adjusted net income for the quarter was $905 million, which resulted in adjusted earnings per share of $2.22. Our Retail and Business Banking franchise delivered another strong quarter with good volume growth in core product and improving margins. Our Wealth Management business had record revenue and net income this quarter. And in a particularly challenging quarter, we continued to successfully execute on our client-focused strategy in Wholesale Banking, generating strong earnings. 
 During the quarter, we had the following items of note. We booked a restructuring charge of $0.09 per share in our CIBC FirstCaribbean business, where we have taken steps to reorganize the business in the face of continuing challenging economic conditions in order to operate more efficiently and better serve our customers. 
 As indicated previously, we had expenses of $0.05 per share during the quarter relating to the proposed credit card transactions with Aimia and TD, including the development and marketing of our enhanced proprietary travel rewards program. In our exited leveraged finance portfolio, we booked an impairment of an equity position related to a legacy loan of $0.05 per share. This was largely offset by a gain from the structured credit run-off business of $0.03 per share, and as with other quarters, the amortization of intangible assets amounted to $0.01 per share. In aggregate, the impact of these items on our earnings netted to a loss of $0.17 per share. 
 Subsequent to the quarter end, CIBC sold an equity investment that was previously acquired through a loan restructuring in our exited European leveraged finance business. This will result in an after-tax gain of approximately $0.13 per share in the first quarter of 2014. 
 The balance of my presentation will be focused on adjusted results, which exclude these items of note. We have included slides with reported results in the Appendix to this presentation. 
 Moving to the details for each of our strategic business units, I'll start with the results for Retail and Business Banking on Slide 8. Revenue in the quarter was $2.1 billion, up $68 million or 3% from the same quarter last year. We had solid gains in our core business lines, partially offset by lower revenue in the other segment. 
 Looking at our individual lines of business. First, revenue in the personal banking segment was $1.7 billion, up $79 million or 5% compared with the same quarter last year. This represented the seventh consecutive quarter where the rate of revenue growth has accelerated. Performance benefited from strong volume growth across CIBC-branded products, which were up 9%, as well as wider spreads and higher fees. Average CIBC mortgage balances grew 15% year-over-year. Our exit from the FirstLine mortgage broker business continues to progress well, with both conversion volumes and spreads well exceeding our targets. 
 Business banking revenue was $384 million, up $6 million or 2% from the same quarter last year due to a combination of higher volumes and fee income, partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates on deposits. Business banking volumes continued to grow with average funds managed up 4% year-over-year. 
 The other segment had revenue of $25 million in the quarter, which is down $17 million compared with the same quarter last year. The 2 main drivers of this variance were lower treasury revenue allocations and lower revenue from our exited FirstLine mortgage business. 
 The provision for credit losses in the quarter was $215 million, down 16% on a year-over-year basis. This reflects the lowest level of loss ratio in almost 6 years. The decrease was largely due to lower write-offs in the card and personal loans portfolios. Each of our consumer lending portfolios in Canada continued to perform well. Laura Dottori will discuss credit quality in her remarks. 
 Our non-interest expenses for the quarter were $1.1 billion, up 3% from the prior year due to higher marketing spend and slightly higher performance-based compensation. We once again achieved positive operating leverage this quarter by continuing to invest in strategic growth initiatives. 
 Net income was $629 million, up $58 million or 10% compared with the prior year. Net interest margin, or NIM, was 266 basis points for the quarter. This was up 3 basis points sequentially and up 8 basis points from the prior year. NIM improvement has been achieved as a result of improved business mix. 
 Turning now to Slide 9. Wealth Management had a very strong quarter with record revenue and net income. Revenue of $472 million, up $52 million or 12% from the same quarter last year, with strong performance from all business lines. Retail brokerage revenue of $272 million was up $16 million or 6% compared with the prior year due to increased assets under administration and higher trading volumes. Asset management revenue of $167 million was up $29 million or 21% from the same quarter last year. This was due to a combination of market appreciation, higher net sales of long-term mutual funds and higher contribution from our investment in American Century Investments. Non-interest expenses of $334 million were up $26 million or 8% from the prior year, mainly as a result of higher performance-based compensation. Net income in Wealth Management was $106 million, up $22 million or 26% from the same quarter last year. 
 Slide 10 reflects the results of Wholesale Banking where we delivered another quarter of strong earnings. Revenue this quarter was $540 million, down $63 million or 10% compared with the prior quarter. Capital markets revenue of $279 million was down $70 million or 20% from the prior quarter, primarily due to a weaker overall market environment. The prior quarter also benefited from a reversal of the credit valuation adjustment against exposures to derivative counterparties. 
 Corporate and investment banking revenue of $249 million was up $6 million or 2% from the third quarter, largely due to higher revenue in U.S. real estate finance, driven by higher CMBS gains in the quarter and higher investment gains, partly offset by lower advisory revenue. The provision for credit losses was a recovery of $1 million for the quarter, mainly due to recoveries in the U.S. real estate finance portfolio. 
 Non-interest expenses were $270 million in the quarter, down $32 million or 11% compared with the prior quarter, primarily due to good expense management and lower performance-based compensation. Net income for Wholesale Banking was $218 million for the quarter, down $5 million or 2% from the prior quarter. 
 CIBC's capital position remains strong with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 9.4%, up from 9.3% in the prior quarter. Capital generated by net earnings was partly offset by higher RWAs. And looking forward to next quarter, the phasing of the credit valuation adjustment capital charge will reduce our CE Tier 1 ratio by 15 to 20 basis points. 
 Our results this quarter capped a year of consistently good earnings. 2013 was a strong year for CIBC, and we made all of our publicly stated medium-term objectives in the areas of earnings growth, return on common shareholders' equity, total shareholder return and balance sheet strength. CIBC's client-focused strategy generated adjusted earnings growth for the full year of 9%. Expenses continued to be well managed, and we met our productivity target with an efficiency ratio at the industry medium. 
 On the subject of expenses, I would like to note that the new accounting standard on pensions, IAS 19, which will be implemented retrospectively in fiscal 2014, will increase our annual pension expense. The increase in our 23 [ph] annual pension expense is approximately $70 million pretax. 
 So to wrap up, we're very pleased with our performance in 2013 with strong contribution from all of our business lines. In Retail and Business Banking, the shift to a client-centric strategy and investment in strategic initiatives are yielding accelerated revenue, expanding margins and improved client experience. Our Wealth Management franchise delivered strong results in both retail brokerage and asset management. Client assets grew 8% from last year, driven by record net sales of long-term mutual funds; and Wholesale Banking delivered solid results in a year characterized by challenging business conditions. 
 Thanks for your attention. And I would now like to turn the meeting over to Laura Dottori. 
 Laura Dottori-Attanasio 
 Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. So I'll be referring to the risk section, which begins on Slide 14, where you'll see that on a reported basis, loan losses were $271 million, so that's down $49 million. On an adjusted basis, they were up $9 million, and that's due to higher losses in CIBC FirstCaribbean and commercial banking, which was partially offset by lower losses in credit cards and corporate banking. 
 We continue to see weakness in our Caribbean portfolio. The tourist industry in particular is yet to fully recover, and this has had impact on our CIBC FirstCaribbean clients. That said, our Wholesale Banking and Canadian retail portfolios continued to perform well. 
 Slide 15 shows that our gross impaired loan level continued to decline in the fourth quarter, with new additions in business, government and consumer portfolios also trended down. So overall, delinquency trends continue to perform well. Unemployment forecasts look flat to down over the next year, which should be a positive for our retail portfolio. Our corporate and commercial portfolios are subject to more sector and event risk. But here, impaired loans have been decreasing, which is positive, barring, of course, any downside risks to the global economy. 
 Slide 16 shows loan losses in our cards portfolio, and they continued to improve. In the fourth quarter, net credit losses decreased to $127 million, and our cards delinquency rate remained low. 
 Turning to Slide 17. You see that 71% of our Canadian residential mortgage portfolio is insured, with 94% of the insurance being provided by CMHC. I'd like to highlight here that this quarter, we revised our loan-to-value calculation. So loan-to-value is now calculated using a weighted average instead of a simple average. So the quarter-over-quarter change, which went from 54% to 60% for uninsured mortgage portfolio, is simply a reflection of the calculation method change. The risk level in our portfolio has not materially changed. 
 But turning to Slide 18, you can see our Canadian residential mortgage portfolio by region. Our total portfolio is $146 billion, with about 46% of that in Ontario, followed by British Columbia at 20% and Alberta at 16%. The credit quality of this portfolio remains high with a net credit loss rate of about 1 basis point per annum. 
 Slide 19 shows our Canadian residential condo mortgage exposure. Condos account for about 11% of our total mortgage portfolio and about 73% of that is in Ontario and B.C. 74% of our condo subportfolio is insured, and the uninsured portfolio has an average loan-to-value of 60%. 
 This slide also shows our condo developer exposure. And you can see, at October 31, our drawn loans to construction projects were $920 million or about 2% of our business in government portfolio. This is down by $8 million from last quarter, and the exposure is diversified across 79 projects. 
 So turning to market risk on Slide 20 you see the distribution of revenue in our trading portfolios as compared with VaR, or value at risk. We had positive results 97% of the time in the fourth quarter, and that compares to 95% of the time in the third quarter. Our average trading VaR was $4.3 million and that's unchanged from the last quarter. 
 So in closing, I'd like to say that our risk performance this year has been solid, with our credit portfolios continuing to perform well and our market risk levels remaining stable. We continuously monitor our portfolio against expected and adverse environments, and we feel that we're well positioned to support the bank in our client-focused strategy. 
 So I'll now turn things back to Geoff. 
 Geoffrey Weiss 
 That concludes our prepared remarks this morning. We'll now move to questions. Operator, can we please have the first question on the phone? 
 "
JDSU," 
   JDS Uniphase Corporation (JDSU) Credit Suisse Technology Conference Call December  4, 2013 11:00 AM ET 
 Operator 
 Okay. I think we will get started. We are very pleased to have from JDSU the CFO, Rex Jackson. I will start with a few questions and then we will hopefully open up the audience. Maybe Rex, you can start by just giving a brief intro to the company, how you are positioned in the optical networking market, and I will take it [Indiscernible]. 
 Rex Jackson 
 Sure. So for people who aren’t necessarily familiar with the story, JDSU is a 1.7 billion, 1.8 billion revenue company. We are -- operate primarily in the network and service enablement space. If you look at the -- though we have three business units, a good 80% of the revenue of the company comes from either building optical components or higher level componentry for [Indiscernible], the CISCOs, the Alcatel-Lucents and the [Indiscernible] of the world to build out new networks, expand existing network et cetera. 
 Then the other part of our business, which is our network and service enablement business unit provides test and measurement equipments and software that allows you to both provision turn up the network when it's new and then after the network is up and running to troubleshoot the network and to use software, and other parts of our portfolio to provide service assurance and other types of services to customers to make sure that the network is performing as expected. 
 So that’s 80% of the company. The rest of the company is a very stable piece of the business, which is our OSP business unit, Optical Security and Performance products primarily operating in the anti-counterfeiting space, very stable business of a couple of hundred million dollars a year, also nicely profitable, good margins in that space. And then we have two other things that we call adjacencies that are actually very interesting as I sit here today. One is gesture recognition, which is in our CCOP business unit. We have done now two generations of a leading gaming product in gesture. That’s been a nice contribution from a revenue perspective to the company. 
 And then we also have a lasers business. It's about $120 million a year as we sit here today. We recently announced a second generation fiber laser that’s supporting our good partner Amada in Japan, and we are very excited about the prospects of that business. So 80% about the network, about 10% to 12% super solid on the anti-counterfeiting side of the business and then a couple of adjacencies that we think are quite interesting as we look out into calendar ’14. 
 Operator 
 Great. Thank you for that intro. And maybe I will just focus first of all on the networking side. Can you speak about the drivers for the market for your business as we head into year-end and into next year, and specifically if we start on what's happening on the 4G side, I think you guys have made and been quite vocal about 4G deployments in terms of how that should be a driver for your business. Can you speak about where we are in terms of that, what the kind of conversations you are having with your customers, and as we head into 2014, is that going to be the year in which you already do see not just the US but a global acceleration of LTE or is it going to be quite piecemeal thing as we go through the year do you think? 
 Rex Jackson 
 So if you focus on the 80% of the business, it is network oriented, what we are seeing today is good strength on the component side in 100G build-outs and surprisingly good strength on the 40G side. We had originally thought that a lot of our customers would want to leapfrog straight from 10 to 100 but the 40G side of it is surprisingly robust. The business that we are seeing on the component side is mostly focused on core build-out and expansion of the network. CCOP, the component side of the business, tends to participate early. 
 So if we see strength in that business typically what that means is as time goes by and if not years, it is months, as months go by, [Indiscernible] then it starts to roll over to the test and measurement business. Both businesses have good portfolios when it comes to the 100G roll out. NSE, network and service enablement, is particularly focused as well on 4G, LTE build-outs. 
 We think we’re well positioned in China. And there is obviously a lot in other regions yet to be done in terms of building out, you know, those core networks. So we are optimistic about calendar ‘14. We think we are very well positioned. If you look at CCOP, one of the things we would like to say internally is that we want to be one or two in the markets that we serve. I think we can confidently say that we have accomplished that on the component side. It's having a very healthy year this year. 
 We feel good about datacom, telecom and datacom in that space, and then when you look at the NSE business, clearly we are number one in field test instruments across the board, and we also think we have good visibility on where the talk is going for network visibility, software defined networks, software optimized networks as people turn up more advanced networks next year. So we also have done -- made a lot of strides over the last two years building out our mobility in wireless portfolio. Thus from a hardware standpoint in terms of everything from base station test to drive test, protocol tests, capacity test, to support the wireless build-out and then we also recently acquired a company named Arieso, that’s good for -- great location where intelligence or intelligence all the way out to the edge. 
 So as it becomes -- the drivers are as it becomes a more wireless world, ever increasing number of attached devices, ever increasing bandwidth requirements, that’s very good in our minds for 80% of our business and we feel like we are very well positioned there. 
 Operator 
 Specifically Rex on the -- you mentioned China there, I guess there has been obviously this discussion all the year about the major TD-LTE roll outs that were supposed to start. However, in terms of we are getting kind of mixed commentary in terms of whether those build outs are happening on time, whether they are being pushed, from your perspective have they already started having impacting on your business and you think you are going to exit 2014, is it really year-end or is it 2014, that’s one question I have on the China side. 
 Rex Jackson 
 Yes. So I think all of us watch the announcements coming out of China over the last x number of months. You know, I think everybody is imminent of the beginning of calendar ’13, wow, there is going to be a huge build out in China this year. That didn’t happen. So likely here at this point for that to happen. We do however -- there are the signs that you would expect and as people do RFPs, and they are doing qualifications, they are doing the lab work necessary to do the front end of a build out, we are getting fairly consistent signals as we have said on our recent earnings call, and I confirm we have good signals that ’14 is going to be very different story. You know, whether or not they do 200,000 base stations, for example, in a quarter or two, I don’t think that's realistic, it's not even logistically realistic, but I do think, you know, a steady and meaningful roll out in China next year should be in the cards. 
 And it's good for us both on CCOP, where we are a very strong supplier to Huawei, ZTE and others on the component side. We won an award last year with Huawei, which we really proud to do so. To the extent that China can use locally sourced products they do. But to become a valued supplier to someone of Huawei heft in that market is actually very good. And then are seeing new signs of capability and penetration on the NSE side in China. If you look back two, three years ago, our bookings or revenue coming from China were extremely small. But we have managed to get a [foothold] there and I think we are looking at increased business there in calendar 2014. 
 Operator 
 And then on -- in terms of other geographies, I guess there seems to be at least a theory of an improved spending environment in western Europe coming, either because of maybe a macro, but also because specifically the commentary that Vodafone has made about how they tend to invest now, I mean, do you think that tangibly we will see as we head into early ’14 or are you seeing any signs of, any indications there from your customers as well and would that be -- do you have got exposure into those carriers, into all the vendors in that market as well? 
 Rex Jackson 
 So, taking the last question first, we definitely have good exposure. Europe tends to be around 25% of our business if you look at the total company. It is [Indiscernible] between 20 and 25 trading off back and forth with Asia-PAC with North America hanging to about 50. We had a pretty good quarter last quarter, which was our Q1, particularly in CCOP, supporting western European customers. To be honest with you we don’t always know where the products go, as they go in to an end, but we did see a nice uptick last quarter in Europe. And that’s frankly something we haven’t seen in quite some time. So one quarter does not a trend make, but we are anticipating that certainly we have been on the bottom. It can only go up next year. 
 Operator 
 Okay. Can you speak a little bit, you mentioned there about the strength in ’14, but also 100G adoption, can you speak about from your business perspective is there a risk or is there opportunity in terms of you adding more value within optical systems as you go for these generations. What has been the experience so far? How did the competitive dynamic change? 
 Rex Jackson 
 Let me make sure I understand your question. Is your question that over time we would be squeezed out or we be able to play -- 
 Operator 
 I’m trying to [Indiscernible] the experience you have had so far on the optical market itself from the system side is relatively consolidated. 
 Rex Jackson 
 Yes. 
 Operator 
 It may consolidate more I guess, but I am trying to think about with all these balances can you supply into that end market? 
 Rex Jackson 
 So I think I would have to divide that question into telecoms versus datacom. I think on the telecom side we have shown ourselves to be very robust in our innovative capabilities. If you look at the percentage of our products that are less than two years old coming out of that business, it's consistently above 60%. We continually innovate and release new products that support telecom, which tend to be longer reach products, and you know, I think when you look at what we are good at which is I presume we have a lot of optical expertise, we know how to make things smaller, how to make things faster, cheaper, low power, lower heat dissipation, that sort of thing. I don’t see us getting squeezed out on the telecom side anytime soon by somebody saying, no, gee, I want to do this myself. 
 So we feel very good about our position there, and we think we are number one in that spot. From a datacom standpoint, that tends to be shorter ratios, a different set of problems. There is more activity in that area, people are wanting to look at doing certain things themselves. Having said that though, just in the last six months, we have been comfortable releasing a percentage our business that’s in datacom. So much like people ask us on our probable side, you know, gee, you used to have 100% market share but now you are of course losing market share. I go, well, once you are at 100, there is no place to go but down. We have a very small market share so we think notwithstanding a slightly different trend in datacom that there is still a lot of room for us to participate in datacom as we move forward. So all in all I think CCOP is in a great spot. 
 Operator 
 Could you speak a little bit more about the adjacent businesses where we are in the development on the gesture recognition, laser side, what the synergy of being in that business from your perspective, and then what's the end game, in case of scaling, do you need to make more acquisitions, how do you grow from here? 
 Rex Jackson 
 So the gesture business is it's actually for us, it's actually fundamentally an extension of 
 our laser capability, right. And laser is actually also because we make our own diodes, which we use in our optical components using gesture, we use them in the lasers business. One of the big advantages that we have gesture is one of those things that if you sell one, you sell millions and then it doesn't tend to be a -- those are not tentative product releases in that area. So one of the advantages that we have is we have the capacity and the capability, and frankly the credibility to do really fast ramps, very high volume and then we actually can withstand turning it all, which is if you look at gen 1 that we did in gesture that’s exactly what happened. You build for three quarters, and then you tail off very, very quickly. 
 And I will expect that to be somewhat similar in gen 2, which we are in now. It just depends on the market acceptance of the product as we go through the Christmas season. But it's a very nicely leveraged part of the business. It doesn’t require nearly the investment that the rest of the business does. It has better margins than our components business. And we actually have established ourselves as the place to go for diodes and the filters to support a gesture application. So we are looking towards in calendar ’14, probably mid to second half, a PC application for gesture for a very, very large supplier. Then we are also deep into development on a TV application as well. 
 So if you look back two years ago, gesture we were -- I hate to call it a one trick pony, but we only had one program. Now we have multiple programs in place and so we are very excited about our abilities there, and we think we have a competitive advantage due to our knowledge in the space, our diode capability and our manufacturing ability. On the laser side, the fiber laser is a very interesting place to be right now. So we think it's a pretty hard area. Our first application is a cutting application. We have our sights on perhaps extending into welding applications. The Gen 2 that was announced several weeks ago, couple of weeks ago, major -- massive improvement over Gen 1 and we are very excited about getting that to market in the May, June time frame. Again also heavily leveraged, better margins. 
 Operator 
 Are there any questions from the audience or I continue? 
 Unidentified Participant 
 I guess specifically with regard to your outlook for 4G deployments and growth, could you talk about growth in the US specifically, obviously US has been on the forefront but how do you see that going forward over the next 6, 12, 18 months? 
 Rex Jackson 
 So I think it's going to be healthy. There is a lot of -- there are a lot of other factors at play right now with some of the major carriers that are distracting them, or taking their eyes off the ball a bit. That’s one of the reasons why we did in our earning calls back in Q1, we didn’t anticipate for example in our guidance a big splash this quarter. This is not where the heads are. But I do think that the climate for investment in ’14 should be better. 
 Unidentified Participant 
 You talked about 200,000 base station deployments not being logistically feasible, can you kind of give us an idea of what is logistically feasible in China, you know, in a good quarter can they do 50,000 base stations, or 100,000 base stations and maybe just how you think about it the variability to ramp from low end to high end if it's a poor ramp or a strong ramp? Thank you. 
 Rex Jackson 
 So not actually in the logistics business, but I -- and I would want to put anything past the ability of the Chinese to do 200 at a pop. I just don’t think that that’s something that makes any sense for them to do at all. I would expect when they start rolling this out, they will do it in a fairly consistent way. There is no compelling reason for them to say we have to get this done in six months. And most of the business activity that we see is more of the steady variety as opposed to the do this in a mass panic sort of way. So, you know, what the exact rate would be, I don’t know. But I actually like the fact that instead of it being this huge spike, it actually would be more fundamentally sound growth business for us. 
 Unidentified Participant 
 Can you just remind us from a dollar content perspective and even from a volume perspective how you win transition to have 4G and 100 gb, just give us any kind of quantification you can on dollar content and volume in those two categories? 
 Rex Jackson 
 Let's see. So that’s primarily on the NSE front or communication side of business? 
 Unidentified Participant 
 [Indiscernible]. 
 Rex Jackson 
 They are in components, okay. Well, it is a tough one because yes, so the reason why that’s hard is if you take for example in our NSE business, network and service enablement, you know we have growth in 4G, what we have is 2G and 3G falling off extremely rapidly. So in our components business, you have similar technology transitions. So if it's -- I would translate it more to what are our growth expectations, right. So I guess you have the gives and takes, but I will tell 80% of the business we are trying to get it to grow in the mid-single digits or better and the main driver of that is going to be the things we talked about here the 100G fundamentally the 100G build out and 4G. So in terms of dollar content, because of our varied portfolio, it will be very difficult to give you that number. 
 Unidentified Participant 
 What would be the operating leverage on a 5% growth rate for the 80% of your business in networking and optical? 
 Rex Jackson 
 Boy, that’s a good question. So that’s quite high. If you look at our NSE business specifically, the way I would explain it to is at about $175 million in revenue per quarter in that business, any incremental dollars above that drop massively to the bottom line. And we have historically high gross margin rates in that business right now. So there we are in the mid to low 60s. So you had a couple -- you take that, if you take a couple of points off for incremental sales expense, and the rest of it drops down. So, you know, if you were to compare December quarter last year, to say last quarter, in that business, you would see that effect. 
 So it's massively beneficial to the margin performance in that business. On the CCOP side, the leverage is not as strong. But you do get some benefits in terms of volume in the manufacturing since we do a lot of our own, I would say incrementally dropping to the bottomline in that business probably be of the order of north of 40% gross margin, but you are really leveraged below that, right. It's not like there is a bunch of little bit of points of sales. It's the same concept yeah. 
 Unidentified Participant 
 [Indiscernible] 
 Rex Jackson 
 It's something like that, yes, yes. 
 Operator 
 Maybe one last question from me just in terms of some of the costumers you supply into on the optical side, and obviously interesting to see why the carrier market and the telco carrier market, many of those carriers around the world outside of the US are under pressure, their supply is under pressure, there seems to be some consolidation that has been obviously in the wireless infrastructure side, some on the optical side, how given that supplying into them has the pricing environment evolved over the last 12 to 18 months basically your business and your products, is there still a continuous pressure how do you factor that into the margins and you guys can make going forward as well? 
 Rex Jackson 
 So, from a pricing perspective, we have not seen meaningful pressure there in either CCOP or NSE last -- we typically give out for CCOP for example a price decline per quarter of 2% to 4%, and we have been operating in the lower end of that range. So we feel pretty god about that and we feel like we are like gaining share, we are picking up business, and so our consolidation there has actually helped us be it suppliers or [Indiscernible] f that. 
 So CCOP we feel that is in pretty good shape. On NSE, we have seen some price competition. It's not consolidation oriented. It's just, you know, on the field of battle relative to some specific competitors. There are some acquisition activity right now that we think will actually be good for us because we are very strong in certain carriers and less so in others. And the ones we are strong with tend to be on the top end of acquisitions that we have seen lately. So though that’s something we need to watch. I actually -- I think that’s not been a negative and indeed might have been -- might be a positive for us looking forward. 
 Operator 
 Okay. With that we are just about out of time. Thanks very much. 
 Rex Jackson 
 Okay, thank you.

TEVA," 
   Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (TEVA) Teva in Focus New Therapeutic Entity from Process to Product Conference Call December  4, 2013  8:00 AM ET 
 
 Operator 
 Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Teva Pharmaceutical Industry Limited, Teva in Focus New Therapeutic Entity from Process to Product Conference Call. My name is Shawn and I’ll be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. (Operator Instructions). 
 As a reminder this call is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to Kevin Mannix, Vice President Global Investor Relations. Please proceed sir. 
 Kevin Mannix 
 Thank you, Shawn. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for the second instalment of Teva’s in focus and new webinar series for the investment community focused on providing an in-depth view of Teva’s R&amp;D strategies and progress in primary therapeutic areas in a format that is focused detailed and accessible. 
 Today’s webinar will provide an in-depth review of our new therapeutic entities or NTE program. The team will outline the global market and unmet needs for each product, highlight the approach and technologies we're using and give you the sense of what are the main products in the pipeline. I'm joined today by Dr. Michael Hayden Teva's President of Global R&amp;D and Chief Scientific Officer, who will lead the webinar and will joined by members of Teva's R&amp;D, regulatory and sales and marketing leadership. Michael and team will present for approximately one hour, for those of you who are unable to access the slide presentation through the webcast, you can download them directly from Teva's website at www.tevapharm.com. 
 Following the presentation, we will open the call for a question and answer period, which will run until approximately 9.30 am Eastern Time. Before we proceed, I'd like to remind everyone that the Safe Harbor language contained in today's presentation pertains in this call and webcast. Our discussions during this event will include forward looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. With that I'll now turn the call over to Dr. Michael Hayden. Michael, if you would please? 
 Michel Hayden 
 Thank you Kevin and thanks to all on the line. Exactly one year ago, during our Teva's Investor Day we presented our NTE strategy. During this year significant progress has been made. During my interactions with many of you, you have raised numerous questions about the NTE process. These have included, can Teva identify sufficient number of new products that address unmet patient needs, will doctors prescribe them, will payers reimburse them, how will Teva commercialize them, what could be their peak fails? 
 The objective of today's webinar is to provide initial answers to some of these questions. We will do this by telling more about some of the products that are currently under development. So where are we today, 12 months of announcing the NTE strategy? Last year, we provided a target of 10 to 15 new products from the NTE program of 2013. We currently have 15 products including 14 products under development, the majority of which will be submitted for approval in the next three years. In addition we have in-licensed Adasuve an approved product that will be launched in early 2014. These products significantly bolster our existing pipeline in core therapeutic areas primarily the CNS. Beyond the product we have created the sustainable platform, an engine that should be enabling us to generate approximately 10 new programs each year. Where could this strategy take us? We believe that the NTE process will be an important growth driver for Teva and generate between 1 billion to 1.5 billion in 2018 and 3 billion by the end of this decade. These numbers are adjusted for risk. 
 We will start today’s webinar by briefly reviewing the strategy rationale for the NTE process at Teva. We will provide a brief overview of 15 new products including more detail on eight of them. We will then take a broader perspective and outline where we will be by 2018 and by the end of this decade. 
 Let’s begin, with the strategic rationale for the NTE strategy, the NTE process generates new specialty products, these products are both based on a known molecule that is formulated, delivered or used in a novel way to address a specific unmet patient need. The risk return profile of such products is attractive the products address a specific unmet need and can potentially generate high returns. The fact that they were based on a known molecule reduces the risk and cost of development. As you know developing a new chemical entity takes 10 to 15 years and may cost between $1 billion to $2 billion from discovery to approval. Development under the product based on a known molecule utilizes and radiate a shorter regulatory [route] 505(b)(2) in the U.S. that allows reference to establish datas after known molecule. This shortens the development timeline that reduces the cost. 
 The molecules that we currently have under development are expected to reach the market in three to six years and the cost of development in each of this is expected to be between $10 to $50 million. The risk of failure of these products is also expected to be lower than a new chemical entity. Based upon recent industry statistics, the chance of success in Phase III on NCE are around 40% while the chances of success of the product developed by the 505(b)(2) routes are significantly higher around 66%. When we look at our current portfolio of 15 products, about 60% of the products are expected to peak sales in the $100 to $300 million range, 40% are expected to peak sales above $300 million. So overall we expect the average products our peak sales of around $250 million. 
 We also expected to secure a substantial period of market exclusivity for products developed from the NTE process, we will use the combination of IP prediction and regulatory exclusivity. From an IP perspective many patent types can be obtained to cover products from our NTE progress, these include patent that cover formulation, dosage, indication and other threshold aspects of the product. This year alone we’ve already filed 11 new patent applications. From a regulatory perspective any development program that involves the clinical efficacy study derived the product with at least a three year regulatory exclusivity in the U.S. and this applies to most of the programs in our portfolio. 
 In case of the open indication a seven year exclusivity can be obtained in the U.S. and 10 years in Europe. If you just take a setback, the NTE process is targeting an attractive space between generics and NCEs with a relatively low-risk and development costs than NCEs combined with potentially significant increase for trend over the generic growth development process. 
 The question you might ask, is why is Teva distinctly position to succeed in this space? The development of product based on known molecules is not a new approach in the industry. Companies have been developing these products under the 505(b)(2) route, since they came into effect in 1999. However in general these programs have not usually on a large scale resulting in a few or a single success story. 
 Our process is differentiated by its scale and ambitions, it’s based on our established capabilities in generics and specialty drug development and the synergies created, when these capabilities are integrated in a single R&amp;D organization. We are falling a newly created by the disciplined process with a very wide mix that generates in a value product ideas and when advancing them from context to markets. And this process is adequately resourced with a dedicated team and a committed budget. This reviews some of these aspects in more detail. 
 As you know Teva has a strong technological base that is fundamental to competitiveness in this space. It's primarily based on the skill set that is evolved over many years and our generic R&amp;D group. We have more than 250 formulators. We have a large portfolio and have developed over a 1,000 molecules and are intimately familiar with its properties and their properties and characteristics. And we have a broader array of complex technologies in house from a long end release its improvement actions. And we have the people, the teams that are developing proprietary formulation approaches and a highly experienced injectable device development team. 
 As a product that we are developing our specialty products, their development requires preclinical, clinical and regulatory development capabilities all already established at Teva R&amp;D. In addition, our specialty R&amp;D team is providing crucial medical perspective and influx about unmet needs and evolving treatment paradigm. 
 Teva's specialty and generic R&amp;D organizations were integrated in mid 2012, creating a very special and unique R&amp;D organization with integrated generic and specialty skill sets. Our process to generate and evaluate these products concept is highly disciplined. We initially caused a wide mix to generate products ideas creating a steady stream of about 20 new product concepts each month. These product concepts are evaluated in a broad into disciplinary process with early involvement of commercial and payer inputs. The process combine both technologic experiments on the one hand and primary physician and payer research. 
 Today, we have evaluated over a 150 product concepts. Most in fact 90% of them has been disqualified along the way, out of this 15 products have emerged, 14 are currently under development and one product Adasuve was in-licensed and is about to be launched. 
 Let’s take now a closer look at the class of 2013. The First four products from the class of 2013 are abuse deterrent opioids, three tablets and one patch. You will hear a lot more about these later in the webinar. We’re also developing two extended release subcutaneous formulations of risperidone an antipsychotics schizophrenia. We will expand on these two products as well. 
 Earlier this year we announced the licensing of Adasuve. Adasuve is a novel inhaled formulation of loxapine, a known drug with a treatment on vegetation associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorders. Adasuve has been approved by the FDA and will soon be launched by Teva in the U.S. We have two additional products that we will not have time to discuss today bringing the total of number of CNS assets to nine. 
 Outside of the CNS we will also briefly discuss two additional products a fixed dose combination glaucoma and a unique and novel product for Crohn’s disease to these which will join our immunology pipeline. The remaining four products are in HIV and details about them will be provided in the future. 
 I would like to introduce three of my colleagues who will provide further detail on several of the products under development, Dr. Jon Isaacsohn the Chief Medical Officer, Elisabeth Kogan, the Head of Generic R&amp;D and Mary Ogle, the Vice President of NTE Commercial. For each product Jon will provide the medical perspective and now the product we are developing addresses an unmet need. Elisabeth will provide the R&amp;D approach to technological challenges and Mary will present the commercial case. 
 I would like now to hand over the discussion to Jon, who will provide the medical perspective on the first four products under development. 
 Jon Isaacsohn 
 Thank you, Michael. The first four products that we are developing are abuse deterrent opioids. Opioids are the most prescribed medications for the treatment of both acute and chronic pain. In the past they have been using patients with pain related to cancer. However, over the course of the last 10 to 15 years their use has expanded and currently they are indicated for the treatment of chronic pain that is not necessarily due to cancer. This includes patients with chronic back pain and other orthopedic and rheumatologic conditions. This expanded role of opioid has resulted in increasing the sales of opioid by greater than 300% over this period of time. 
 Here is a graph of the effects of opioid. As the concentration of opioids in the blood increases the analgesic or pain reliving effect is produced. With higher amounts in the blood a feeling of euphoria is produced. This feeling of euphoria is the core reason leading to addiction. With time higher and higher amounts are needed to achieve the state of euphoria and prevent with brutal symptoms. In order to achieve high opioid, levels multiple tablets can be taken simultaneously. Patients who are addicted to the effects of high dose opioid have found ways of extracting the opioid from the opioid tablets by crushing the tablet and snorting it through the nose or dissolving the tablets in the water or alcohol and injecting it intravenously. Patches can be chewed, sucked applied to abraded skin, heated and chemically manipulated for injection or brood as (inaudible).  
 In this graph, the blue line represents the concentration of opioid in the blood after receiving an oral tablet. This is the level needed for pain relief over an extended period of time. 
 By tampering with the tablet or the patch, a higher amount of opioid can be delivered which is able to induce the [statement] of euphoria. This can be seen with the purple line. Abuse of [opioid,] prescription opioid has become a major health problem in the U.S. As is evidenced from these numbers, the problems are staggering and increasing from year-to-year. In 2011, there were over 17,000 deaths related to an overdose of prescription opioids. 
 As the individuals use higher amounts of opioids to get the high, it’s not difficult to see how they can get to a blood concentration, high enough to cause respiratory depression and death. The [cause] of the healthcare system reflects this emerging epidemic. 
 In order to address the healthcare crises, the FDA has emphasize the importance of the developing abuse deterrent formulations of opioids and has earlier this year issued draft guidelines on what their expectations are for abuse deterrent formulations. 
 The FDA also barred generic versions of OxyContin without tamper-resistant properties. It is anticipated that by 2018, 50% of the opioid market in U.S. will contain abuse deterrent technology. In view of this clear need, we are developing a portfolio of abuse deterrent opioids based on a proprietary and differentiated abuse deterrent technology. In order to explain this technology, I will turn it over to Elisabeth Kogan, our Head of Generic R&amp;D. 
 Elisabeth Kogan 
 Thank you, Jon. Teva has developed OraGuard, a proprietary technology for oral tablet in order to tamper the treat (inaudible) of abuse of opioids. Crush into a powder in order to snort or swallow, dissolve in water to inject or dose dumping when injected with alcohol. This technology enables development of both immediate release and sustained release for our product. 
 The technology is based on the use of multi-layer gel-forming polymer coating of the opioid particles that provides tablets with abuse determine properties. The OraGuard technology basically combines three physical and chemical values what we call gelling, barrier and matrix. 
 The objective is to regulate the drug release at the desire grade when used and prescribed and to better extraction of the drug from the product. Teva has granted and pending IP covering a proprietary OraGuard technology. 
 When the OraGuard is exported to small amount of fluid, it forms a gel preventing easy manipulation like for instance injection. As you can see from this graph, the presence of alcohol does not affect the release of the opioid. In blue, you can see the in vitro impact of alcohol on non-abuse deterrent extended release opioid of product that was pulled from the market. 
 After two hours 65% of the opioid was released in presence of alcohol compared to 18% without alcohol. In red, you can see the in vitro results of abuse deterrent extended release what we call program AD3. After two hours only 17% of the opioid is released in presence of alcohol. This is a very important feature for extended release products and user may inject such products when having had alcohol risking dose dumping. 
 In addition when an OraGuard tablet is crushed, polymer remains bound to opioid and it protects against crushing and snorting. Our in vitro assessment of the impact of snorting shows that only a small amount of drug would be delivered if crushed and snorted. The blue bar on the chart represents the conventional immediate release products which released 89% opioid after 10 minutes on dose snorting conditions. The red bar represents OraGuard abuse deterrent 1 immediate release which releases only 26% after 10 minutes on dose snorting conditions. 
 We believe that OraGuard is a unique abuse deterrent technology. When most abuse deterrent products utilize one to two deterrent mechanisms, OraGuard combines three physical and chemical barriers. As a result, OraGuard has a very good deterrent performance against the three most common ways of abuse crushing for snorting, IV extraction, dose dumping in alcohol. This was already demonstrated in a successful liking study with OraGuard extended release hydrocodone. In vitro data indicates that the deterrent effects also work for immediate release. 
 At the moment we have four NTEs in chart of 2013 based on abuse deterrent properties; Three oral tablets using OraGuard technology AD1, AD2 and AD3 and one patch using a different technology AD4. This is in addition to Teva’s CEP-33237 which is currently in Phase 3 with expected trial results in April 2014. 
 In January 2013, FDA issued a draft guidance on the regulatory path to approval of abuse deterrent opioids. We have been (inaudible) for the cause for PK and for what is called liking study which are studies in patients with opioid dependence to prove that they don’t like the product. 
 The three NTEs based on OraGuard technology AD1, AD2 and AD3 have a development program based on PK and liking study and do not require Phase 3. The in vitro wok is almost completed. And we expect to complete the PK studies in 2014 followed by the liking study. The objective is to submit these three products towards the end of 2015. 
 On the patch, the condition development in the prior PK, liking study and Phase 3 study. Submission is expected in 2018. 
 With that I would like to ask Mary Ogle to present the commercial perspective. 
 Mary Ogle 
 Thank you, Elisabeth. Our commercial approach to the NTE portfolio is just like any other commercial launch. Early in the process, we invest meaningful market research with both physicians care segments to earn insights and keep product attributes that will best track utilization at optimal pricing. 
 We conduct qualitative and quantitative market research with over 300 physicians which include a top 10 specialists and primary care physicians to understand the value in decision making process for product selection. And the reaction is overwhelmingly positive. 
 Physicians recognize the need for the effective products that would minimize the potential for opioid abuse. This [misuse] is top on mind when prescribing this class of pain medication due to the potential impact not only on the patients but on family members as well. Furthermore, physicians stated that abuse deterrents add another layer of protection and freedom to prescribe without the fear of abuse. 
 In addition to our physician research, we also stopped just 37 managed care decision makers throughout the United States, which include a representation from both national and regional account. These experts manage all large insurance segments which include commercial Medicare and Medicaid patients. 
 It was clear from our interviews that we conducted with our peers that they recognize the need for abuse deterrent opioid products due to the large economic burden on the healthcare budgets and the overall impact to the U.S. healthcare system. In our research, we specifically asked about acceptable price points for the abuse deterrent products we are developing. The research confirmed that we can expect to command brand like prices, currently in the range of $10 to $20 per day and they will be granted at either a Tier 2 or Tier 3 standard reimbursement level depending on contracting. 
 The rationale for this price acceptance was due to offset in indirect cost associated with emergency room visits, hospitalizations and increased office visits. The opioid market today is valued at over $8.2 billion and we project the market to reach $11.3 billion by 2023. 
 We anticipate growth [featuring] by new abuse deterrent formulations and turn into the market over the next 10 years. The abuse deterrent segment of the market is expected to be approximately of $5 billion by 2018 and over $7 billion by 2023. 
 Where will we compete in this multi-billion market? Over the next four years, Teva will launch five new abuse deterrent opioid products in segments covering 70% of the overall opioid market volume. 
 We have a clear map of the competitive landscape in each of these segments. And we expect to encounter one to three competing products. Based on the research conducted, we believe that we have a highly competitive offering. And in some of these segments, we can expect to be first or second to market. 
 We will have a broad portfolio of abuse deterrent opioids that will grant physicians prescribing flexibility and security, allowing them to focus on the patient rather than the negative consequences associated with misuse. 
 The OraGuard technology further differentiates that value proposition. Overall, we believe that Teva is positioned to a meaningful share of the overall abuse deterrent segment. 
 We intend to leverage our strong footprint in CNS as a platform to market the abuse deterrent products. Our commercial infrastructure in CNS is comprised of over 500 sales professionals. Of the 500, 70 sales professionals are currently solely dedicated to pain specialists focusing on our existing portfolio of pain products including Actiq, Fentora, and Amrix. 
 The pain team will be scaled up in order to adequately support the abuse deterrent portfolio at time of launch. In addition to our sales and marketing infrastructure, we will leverage our U.S. managed market teams to provide and ensure access in major markets. 
 In summary, we believe that the broad offering of side abuse deterrent products, the innovative technology and the strong commercial footprint places Teva in a strong position in this growing multi-billion dollar market.

 The next two products that we are going to present is long acting risperidone for the treatment of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder characterized by a breakdown of thought processes and by a deficit of typical emotional responses. The disease is chronic requiring long-term therapy. It is usually diagnosed in early adulthood and with treatment can be reasonably well controlled in most cases. However, the course is often punctuated by episodes of relapse, requiring emergency room business and sometimes hospitalization. The disease affects approximately 2.2 million individuals in the U.S. with the total healthcare cost of $63 billion. 
 The treatment of schizophrenia involves the use of antipsychotics medication of which the atypical group is the most commonly used. Risperidone is one of the most widely used atypical antipsychotics and is available in two dose forms, an oral formulation and an intramuscular injection given every two weeks. 
 The characteristic of schizophrenia treatment is the very high rated non-adherence to the prescribed regimen. Non-adherence has been found in different studies to be approximately 40% within the first year and 75% within the first two years of therapy. When patients stop taking their medication, they often relapse and require hospitalization. 
 The long acting injectables are clearly better than the oral antipsychotics for preventing relapses and re-hospitalizations. In fact in some studies, it has been demonstrated that there is a 60% reduction in hospitalization when patients are treated with long acting injectables. 
 Adherence is enhanced by virtue of the patient needing to come to a doctor’s office or clinic in order to receive the injection. These long acting injectables are also associated with less side effects, particularly the Parkinson movement’s impairments which are characteristic side effects of the antipsychotic drugs. The reason toward this is the lower concentrations of the drug in the blood compared to when they receive oral medications. 
 Because of the frequency of relapses after initiating therapy with the oral formulations, there is now accumulating data demonstrating the value of getting the long acting injectables as the initial treatment immediately after the diagnosis of schizophrenia is made and treatment is deemed necessary. 
 Despite these obvious advantages of the long acting injectables, they are actually not as widely used as they could be as there are many drawbacks. Patients and physicians are often reluctant to results from injections overall oral agents. The most widely prescribed long acting injectable is Risperdal Consta. It needs to be given every two weeks as an intramuscular injection usually into the buttock. 
 This particular medication requires 17 steps to reconstitute the formulation. Given these limitations, currently the long acting injectables are usually prescribed only after a patient has shown him or herself to be non-adherent to the oral regimen. Today approximately 10% of schizophrenic patients are receiving long acting injectables. 
 We have two formulations of risperidone, one that will be given once a month and the other one that can be given every three months. It will be administered by our subcutaneous injection, which is clearly less painful than an intramuscular injection. 
 The subcutaneous injection will be given into the arm or abdomen which is less intrusive. It will also be available as a syringe with minimal reconstitution steps. It is anticipated that by virtue of the more acceptable subcutaneous injection, the population of schizophrenic patients that will receive long acting injectables will be expanded. 
 Elisabeth will now provide certain detail on our long acting injectables. 
 Elisabeth Kogan 
 Well, Jon explained to you, our objective is to develop a significantly better long acting injectable product. The graph you can see is illustrative. The blue line represents a profile of Risperdal Consta, the approved long acting injectable; the red line represents our targeted profile. 
 We are targeting three main improvements. The first one is related to the 21 days lack of risperdal which return to eliminate in order to achieve to (inaudible) at day one, so eliminating the need for oral pre-treatment fees. The second advantage is to expand relief profile from two weeks to three months. The third advantage is that it should be given subcutaneously not intramuscularly. In Teva, we have established long acting release injection capabilities and passed on our [contract] generic strategy. 
 For risperidone, we have created multiple technologies to achieve a three month profile, both internal and external and have selected a very promising platform. Our solution is based on the cutting edge technology, co-developed with a partner, not micro share based. 
 The leading formulation prototype was chosen and in-vitro in-vivo correlation model has been established for the once a month product. Once a month release has been achieved in vitro and in initial preclinical studies. This formulation is awaited for the three month formulation which is under development with promising initial release profile. 
 In terms of next steps, we expect to complete the formulation prototype of the one month and three month products during the first half of 2014 and to start the PK in human late 2014 early ‘15. We plan for pre-clinical PK in Parkinson disease during ‘14, ‘15 followed by taking clinical programs starting in 2016. The targeted submission date is 2018 in both U.S. and Europe. 
 The main risks of this program are related to our ability to keep the balance of not exceeding the highest (inaudible) confrontation and not going below the minimal effective concentration for 90 days. 
 After screening multiple technologies, we believe we have selected the most promising platform and are moving ahead with this program. 
 We conducted in-depth quantitative market research with over 350 physicians in the U.S. and EU5. Our primary objective was to understand the acceptance, usage and the role of a three month subcutaneous injection in the treatment of schizophrenia patients. Our research confirmed high acceptance for three months subcutaneous risperidone molecule. Key reasons mentioned are the known molecule and the positive impact to patient adherence with potential for better patient outcomes. 
 The level of excitement was evident, comes like this is a game changer and potential for earlier treatment or indicative of many positive responses received in our research. Response from Payors was also positive. Payors are highly aware of the lack of adherence and cost associated with increase in relapse, emergency room visits and hospitalization. 
 The value proposition of a three month subcutaneous injection was recognized by payors as an advancement in the treatment of schizophrenia. A 10% to 20% premium over the total cost of a three month treatment regimen was current -- with current long acting injectables will be fully reimbursed with open formulary access. 
 In 2012, the antipsychotics market value was approximately $11 billion; by 2022 the market is expected to decline due to generic entrance into the oral segment. However, the long acting injectable segment is growing rapidly, driven by introduction of multiple new products and expected to reach more than $3 billion by 2017. 
 What will be the competitive landscape in the long acting injectables segment upon our expected launch in 2019? The long acting injectable market will be occupied by a few players, mostly focused on a once monthly formulation of intramuscular. Our research confirms that our product will be clearly differentiated from these products based on a dosing frequency and the subcutaneous route. 
 We also anticipate one competing agent with the three months dosing. The active compound will be paliperidone administered intramuscularly. Our products will be differentiated from the three months paliperidone on the less painful subcutaneous routes and the properties of risperidone with which the doctors have had extensive clinical experience. 
 Risperidone acting injectable subcutaneous represents a truly global opportunity for Teva. Currently we plan to utilize the current CNS sales and marketing infrastructure in the U.S. and the EU with 500 and 400 sales professionals respectively, with the potential to expand into other markets. 
 Our neuropsychiatry team has the successful track record in launching and driving sales for such products such as Nuvigil, Provigil and Clozapine. Our managed care team has extensive experience and relationships with key managed care organizations due to optimal pricing and permanent access upon launch. 
 In summary by 2017, we expect the long acting injection market to exceed $3 billion. Both physicians and payers have confirmed that Teva has a unique and differentiated products offering. 
 Combined with the strong commercial footprint, we believe that we are in a strong position to capture meaningful share in this multi-billion dollar market.

 The next product we are presenting is the fix dose combination of the prostaglandin agonist and the beta blocker for the treatment of glaucoma. Glaucoma is the progressive optic neuropathy caused mainly by increased intraocular pressure. It occurs in the elderly but can affect the younger individuals. In 2010, 2.7 million people in U.S. were diagnosed with glaucoma. It is anticipated that by 2020 with the aging of the population that about 3.6 million people in the U.S. will have glaucoma. 
 With prolonged elevation of intraocular pressure, the patient experiences progressive loss of vision, in fact glaucoma is the second largest reason for blindness in the western world. Treatments to lower ocular pressure can prevent the progressive loss of vision. As seen in this cartoon of the eye, glaucoma is caused by an imbalance in the inflow and outflow of fluid called aqueous humor in the inferior of the eyeball, relatively greater inflow and relatively lesser outflow of this fluid results in greater intraocular pressure which ultimately leads to optic nerve damage. 
 The initial treatment to address this imbalance is the use of a prostaglandin agonist, this increases is the outflow of fluid and there by reduces the intraocular pressure. If the prostaglandin agonist does not reduce the pressure adequately a beta blocker is added. The beta-blocker reduces the production of fluid and in this manner reduces the intraocular pressure. Glaucoma is a chronic disease that requires continued life-long treatment current treatment involves multiple administrations of eye drops each day and studies have shown that over the course of a year, approximately 30% of prescribed doses are mixed. It has also been shown that non-adherent increases with a number of administration each day. 
 In the U.S. prostaglandin agonist and beta blockers are prescribed separately and requires three administrations per day once for the prostaglandin agonist and twice a day for the beta blockers. Although the medications are given as drop into the eye some of the medication is absorbed into the systemic circulation. This is also in the pace with the beta-blocker eye drops this can cause side effects outside of the eye. With beta blocker, we see a slowing of the heart rate, reduction in blood pressure to peak and reduce performance during exercise. It can also be associated with reduced pulmonary function and difficulty with breeding particularly in elderly patients with underlying respiratory problems. 
 We are developing a once a day fixed dose combination of a standard dose of a prostaglandin agonist together with a low dose beta blocker. This innovative formulation enables us to achieve a similar efficacy to the standard doses with reduced systemic exposure to the beta blocker and therefore less side effects associated with the beta blocker. The use of this combination approach should also improve adherence to the prescribed regimen. 
 Elisabeth will now describe our development approach. 
 Elisabeth Kogan 
 NTE is another example of leveraging generic R&amp;D formulation experience as fast as the integrated R&amp;D strategy. In the space of technology, Teva already developed 20 products for the generic business comprising of solutions but also complex emulsions and suspensions. 
 We also had experience in developing both preservative and preservative free formulation. In addition, Teva has manufacturing capabilities in a wide range of fill and finish options for ophthalmic products including standard multi-dose bottle, blow, fill seal unit dose, preservative free multi-dose bottle. These technology platforms are being applied extensively to develop ophthalmic NTE. 
 We have already made good progress in formulation of these NTEs and have finalized and advanced prototype. Preclinical developments will start next month. The development strategy include the clinical development program with Phase I safety assessment, Phase II and Phase III. This will be done between 2015 and 2017. The submission is planned in 2018 in the U.S. it should be noted that additional NTE around the evaluation in the space of technology leveraging Teva’s existing capability. The goal is to create the best ever product in this space. 
 And I will provide the commercial approach for glaucoma in the fixed dose combination. The U.S. Glaucoma market is expected to grow from $2 billion in 2012 to close to $3 billion in 2023. The increasing demand for fixed dose combination is expected to shift to current treatment landscape. By 2023 the fixed dose combination segment is expected to reach $750 million in the U.S. sales alone. 
 Our research has validated high acceptance and medical need for the fixed dose combination we are developing. In fact 75% of all physician surveys stated a strong intent to prescribe due to a more convenient dosing schedules, better patient compliance and the improved safety profile. We expect to capture meaningful share with the fixed dose combination market in Glaucoma. 
 Payers acknowledge the improvement of a fixed dose combination for this patient population as well. This therapeutic area is viewed as an inexpensive managed market segment for the Payers and thus they have no major concerns for reimbursement today. 
 The ophthalmology market is a highly acceptable market to commercialize for promotion the targeted physician universe is approximately 22,000 in size requiring a small number of sales professionals to achieve commercial success. We will leverage our Teva select brand positions which has the strong track record of driving sales in specialty markets. We expect to grow our ophthalmology franchise of new products are identified.

 The next product that we are going to prevent is direct release 6 mercaptopurine for Crohn’s disease. Crohn’s disease is an auto immune disease characterize by inflammation of the lining of the intestine which spreads to involve deeper layers of the affected areas adopt. The inflammation results in abdominal pain, diarrhea, bleeding (inaudible) track and nutritional deficiencies, it then involve different areas of the digestive tracks in different people. 
 The treatment of Crohn’s disease is governed by disease severity the treatments of moderate Crohn’s disease involves the use of anti-inflammatory agents. In the setting of most severe disease immunosuppressive agents are usually needed. The most widely used immunosuppressive agents for the cases of moderate disease are 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine. 
 6-mercaptopurine or 6-MP is an immunosuppressive agent that is very affected with a response rate of approximately 54%, interestingly 6-MP is actually approve for the treatment of acute lymphocytic leukemia that is widely used open label to treat Crohn’s disease. 
 The major drawback of treatment with the regular 6-MP is myelosuppression characterized by reductions in white and red blood cell counts. This can lead to a greater stability to infection and anemia it can also called liver function abnormalities. 
 Our formulation of direct release 6MP involves the targeted release of 6MP in the intestine with the minimal absorption into the systemic circulation. The formulation incorporates two formulation technologies. One that delays the release until the drug is in the intestine and the second that results in the rapid release of the drug once it is in the intestine. We have done some initial studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the direct release 6MP compared to the regular formulation of 6MP in patients with Crohn’s disease. In an exploratory Phase I study 11 patients received a single dose of either direct release 6MP or regular 6MP. 
 The concentrations in the plasma of the two formulations of the 6MP are shown in this graph. The regular 6MP in blue and the direct release 6MP in red. As exhibited, there is minimal absorption of the direct released 6MP into the systemic circulation indicating in this very preliminary study that the direct release 6MP does not enter into the systemic circulation in any meaningful amounts. 
 In a exploratory Phase II study, 24 patients were randomized to recieve either direct release 6MP or regular 6MP daily for 12 weeks. The end point was at the Crohn’s disease activity index as scoring system that is designed to evaluate the symptoms related to Crohn’s disease. This has been used to evaluate the effects of this addressable Crohn’s disease for many years. 
 The results of the study demonstrated as similar reduction in the Crohn’s disease activity index score from baseline to week 12 with both formulations of 6-MP. With the reduced absorption of direct release 6-MP demonstrated in the Phase I study. We expect the systemic immunosuppressive effects of the direct release 6-MP to be next. 
 Overall, we expect that the direct release 6-MP will have a safety advantage over the regular 6-MP that with a similar efficacy profile. The continued development of direct release 6-MP will involved another Phase I Pharmacokinetic study with multiple doses of direct release 6-MP compared to multiple doses of regular 6-MP to confirm the absence of significant absorption and the dose ranging Phase II study during 2014 through 2016. Phase III studies in Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis will be done to establish the safety and efficacy of direct release 6-MP during 2017 and 18 with a planned submission in 2019. 
 Direct release 6-MP could have a significant commercial potential. The global markets for Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis is $7 billion with the non-TNF segment, capturing $2 billion. It is anticipated that direct release 6-MP will capture a meaningful share of the non-TNF segments of the market.

 Thank you Jon, Elisabeth and Mary for your clear presentations. I'd like to conclude today's webinar by taking a broader perspective on the NTE strategy. Exactly one year ago we introduced the NTE strategy has an approach to generate new products for our pipeline. During just one year 2013 this process has generated a total of 15 products, 14 organically grown at Teva and 1 in-licensed product the majority of these products are in our established therapeutic areas in the CNS and significantly strengthened our pipeline in CNS and pain. 
 The following chart shows our R&amp;D programs in multiple sclerosis, neuropsychiatry and neurodegeneration. The gray bars represent our current pipeline product such as you can see the laquinimod in multiple sclerosis, pridopidine and the laquinimod in Huntington disease. The red bars represent the new products from the NTE process. Each bar starts when the product is expected to reach the market about one year following submission. 
 As you can see the NTE program from the class of 2013 has significantly strengthened our pipeline in this area you can see the same situation in pain. Here the NTE process again and the products are shown in red and you can see that the NTE process in pain just as these and other areas is an effective approach to expanding our pipeline in our core therapeutic areas. 
 The following chart shows the expected submissions of the 14 products under development overtime from the class of 2013. You can see we expect one submission in ‘14 five in ‘15 and so on. You can see the impact of the short developed timelines of the NTE projects, but the majority of these submission, eight of them occurring in the next three years. 
 Now in, 2013 we have generated new pipeline assets, but importantly, we also have put in place a platform, an engine that is capable of generating new product every year. Our target for 2014 is to generate approximately 10 new pipeline assets which will be repeated each year thereafter, and here you can see in red the expected dates of submission for our 2013, submission class in red and in blue those coming from the class of 2014, a total of eight submissions in 2015 and thereafter. 
 We believe that the NTE process will generate the total of approximately 30 new pipe line assets by the end of this decade. And what you can see here is the gray represents the class of the 2015 to 2017 submissions and this is added every year to the class of 2014 and before that class of 2015 submissions. 
 Now the sales potentials of these assets as we have outlined will be significant. Before adjustment for risk, we believe that these 50 top line assets for the process of 2013 to 17 have the potential to generate approximately $2 billion in 2018 and up to $5 billion by 2020. 
 However we are fully aware of fact that not all programs will make it to market, while development risk of NTEs is lower than that of the new chemical entity, the programs may fail for a variety of risks including technological optical, difficulty in formulations, issues in clinical development, regulatory, IP, limit exclusivity and also to competitive products. As we have embarked on each of these programs, we had clearly identified the specific risk associated and have already plans in place to mitigate them. Overall our estimates of eight on for 10 programs that we have now initiated, we expect about six to make it to market. So as we plan to initiate approximately 50 programs by 2017, we expect about 30 of them to reach the market. 
 Business translated in a risk adjusted way through an expected potential of about $1 billion to $1.5 billion in 2018 and conservatively $3 billion in 2020. We believe the NTE process will be a significant growth engine for our specialty business. 
 These revenue projections we believe are realistic, as long as we continue to generate new product that fundamentally address unmet patient needs. I think hopefully we’ll be able to provide you with some compliments that the engine is in place to do just that. We also detailed that we have provided you about the products from the class of 2013 illustrates how they may provide benefit to patients, importantly, improving efficacy, treatment outcome, reducing side-effects and improving the quality of the life. 
 In this way, they will also provide benefit to clinicians by allowing them to ensure that patients (inaudible) to treatment and reduce risk of misuse and inappropriate use, and of course as such that will provide benefit to payers for our reducing the overall cost of treatment and improving the quality of life of patients and this will be a contribution to the communities in which they live. 
 In summary, we believe that we are pursuing a differentiated model in the industry with an attractive risk return profile. The model is built on established expertise at Teva integrated now in another way. 2013 was a year of significant progress, during which we generated multiple new pipeline assets and created a platform to sustain this performance into the future. I want to thank you for your attention and we look forward to your questions. 
 I'd also like to introduce, we are joined by two of our other leaders in R&amp;D, Jim Ottinger from Regulatory and Sharon Hausdorff from Intellectual Property and Legal who are there to provide on to hefty operations in those areas.

ZAGG," 
   ZAGG Incorporated (ZAGG) LD Micro Conference December  4, 2013  6:30 PM ET 
 Randall Hales 
 Chris [ph], as the sun is starting to settle a little bit out there, it's a lot easier to bring people in here because -- 
 Unidentified Participant 
 That is true. Kind of getting cold out here. 
 Randall Hales 
 It is. First time in Southern California. We're flying back to Salt Lake City tonight. We're -- I think I've got 12 inches of snow on my driveway, so if anyone wants to come snowboarding, you're welcome. 
 Thank you for being in here. I'm going to run through a number of slides. Is the volume okay? A little high. Okay. 
 I'm going to run through a number of slides. We'll keep about 10 minutes at least at the end of my comments so we can just open it up for some Q&amp;A. 
 Safe Harbor. We can move right through that. 
 I thought I'd start by telling you what's working and what's not working at ZAGG kind of at a high level, and then as I go through the presentation, we'll drill down to each one of these in some form or fashion. So what's working? 
 Increased profitability in the latter half of the year. You know, we've gone through a period of some revenue compression and yet the business has become more profitable. That's to tell you that I think the work that we've done this year, kind of reinventing the company and building a foundation that we can grow from seems to be starting to pay off in that regard. 
 Secondly, we are generating a significant amount of free cash flow from operations. We're using that to decrease debt. We paid down debt over $26 million this year. In addition to that, our board had authorized a $10 million share repurchase that is to be completed before the end of the year. So you can -- gives you a sense of what we've been doing with the cash. 
 We've got category leadership in some very important categories to us. Our biggest happens to be screen protection. I'll talk about what we're doing in that category going forward. We're number two in keyboards. And we're doing better than you probably realize in audio, I'll talk about some specifics there. 
 We've got a very robust product pipeline in through 2014, much of which we'll be showing at CES here in just a couple of weeks. I brought a few little products to share with you and demo today and give you a peek with some of that. 
 And then strengthening our team with some great new hires. We've recently hired a new COO who is a former president of Sanyo North America. So we're really starting to -- we've done the same thing on the sales side of the organization, just starting to bring in some skill sets and experience base that we've really needed in the organization. 
 What's not working? Much of our shortfall this year relative to both plan and last year's performance really came down to a sales execution situation where we had a strategic plan that look really good on paper going into the year, but the tactical execution did not achieve what we needed it to. And again I'll talk about that in more detail in a following slide. 
 Inventory management has been something that has plagued us as a young organization growing and maturing a little bit in forecasting and supply chain disciplines -- detailed sales forecasting I mentioned. 
 Reliance on Apple product launches. Apple product launches over the last three or four years have been tremendous boost to our revenue. We love that. Unfortunately, we didn't have a spring launch with Apple and we didn't have a form factor change in the fall launches and it impacted our business quite significantly. So what are we doing to change the business so we're not so dependent on that. 
 We had two key product delays this year. One was a game controller, mobile game, and we'll talk about, and the other was an audio product that was our first of the -- in this category of desktop audio, that we ran into some technical issues on. We're finding that launch that is about six months later than we had planned. And then in the past we've been, as an organization, very inconsistent in the timing of our product launches and we've just now moved to correct that. 
 With that foundation, I'm going to move through the slides pretty quickly. We have three strategic objectives at ZAGG that we talk about all the time, we're working against. Everything for us starts with creative product solutions. We're a consumer products company with a very young and emerging brand. Therefore, the most important thing we can do is really focus on this, make sure we've got great products in the market at the right time that move the needle for our retailers that are pulling off shelf [ph], and that tends to be our number one focus. I'm going to talk about that, kind of show you where we are. 
 This slide, there's a lot going on, but we've listed the product categories on the far left that we participate in today. The second column indicates our current market position, our revenue contribution of that line, gross margin as compared to guidance, and then what the sales trends are for us right now. 
 So I'll take that first one, invisibleSHIELD to screen protection as a category. We have the number one market position in the domestic market today. It's our number one revenue contributor. It contributes gross margin above guidance. And sales this year have trended down just a little bit. 
 Tablet keyboards were number two in the market, second to Logitech. The revenue contribution for us is a number two position. It generates gross margin right at guidance. And it's trending up for us. We just launched a new product that we can't build fast enough right now. It's a keyboard that works with the new iPad Air. I don’t know if any of you in here using that iPad Air today. If you've tried to get a ZAGG keyboard, you'll have to take a number and get in line like I have had to. They're hard to find today. 
 Audio, we are in the top five audio brands in the domestic market today, which is really interesting. We sell the audio products under the iFrogz brand. When you guys think of personal audio, you're probably thinking Skullcandy, JVC, Beats, Sony and so on. We've surprised a lot of people this year with some recent MPD data. We are the number two by unit volume best-selling personal or ear-bud product in the market today under our iFrogz brand. We're number one in over-the-ear or headphones price under $15. So both of those product lines sell under our iFrogz brand which is a value position brand, and we do very well there. 
 As we come on down in cases, it's our number four revenue contributor. We're in the top ten of companies out there. You tend to think of Autobox and Lifeproof, those are great competitors of ours. It contributes below guidance. And that business has trended down for us this year. 
 Power management is the last one I'll walk you through. We see that as an expanding category and a real opportunity for us. Devices are more power-hungry than they've ever been, and I remember I have a laser pointer, but we're in the top five currently, and there hasn't been a clear market leader emerge yet in this category. It contributed to that guidance. We were down this year as we revamped that product line. We'll relaunch at CES coming up. 
 This is a look at some of the new products. This is a protective case that we just launched. We got distribution in at Best Find [ph] now. It's called the Arsenal. It's an invisibleSHIELD line extension that can complete the case protection. Some new keyboard products that we launched in the last couple of months. This happens to be a universal keyboard, works with any operating system -- Android, iOS and Microsoft -- and we're getting good traction there. 
 And then of course the new keyboard for the iPad Air which is the thinnest, lightest keyboard product that we've ever launched as a company, and I'd really encourage you to go out online and read the reviews of this keyboard versus some of the competition. 
 Some new power products, speaker systems. I brought one that I wanted to show you. This little product here will be introduced at CES. I'm going to give you a little down-low preview today. It's about the size of a key fob. Currently this is the smallest Bluetooth speaker that we're aware of in the market today, and we've shown it to just a few of our customers. The idea is that this is a go-anywhere music with you. It clips into a backpack or a purse or a briefcase, on bike handlebars, etcetera, and I'll let you hear the sound quality. 
 Okay. So I got it turned down. Let me turn it up here, hold to my mic. 
 The idea behind it is it was designed to open up some distribution to us that were not currently in price point and form factor. It opens up C stores [ph], pharmacy and the travel market which we haven't participated in at a price point of $19.99. So, great, great, great value. 
 If I go back one chart and look at the personal audio line, we would say that this is coming in right at the guidance level gross margin. So it's a great contributor for us and we think a form factor that'll do very well. I've had two or three that have been trying this for me already today, I've got my eye on it. 
 Gaming -- we talked a little bit at CES last year about mobile gaming and talked about getting this as a category because we saw that as an emerging opportunity with mobile computing. And indeed it was. However, we designed our original controller on a Bluetooth format, and in June of this year, Apple came out and said, no, we're going to change the standard and require you to game through the lightning port on the bottom of the phone. That caused us to have to go back in and redesign our game controller from the ground up. And we've been doing that with Apple checkpoints all the way along. We touch base with them every two weeks. 
 And what we've come up with is this controller that we call the Caliber Edge on the bottom, and it's currently awaiting Apple MFI approval. Once we have that, we'll start selling it into the market. It does some things that no controller on the market does today. The controllers that are out there, there's just a couple now, don't allow you to use your phone as a communication device any longer. Once you're in game play, you can't take and receive calls or make calls. 
 We've found a way and we've worked closely again with our engineering team and check ops with Apple where you can be in game play, actually receive a call, and it'll pause game play and then go right back in once you've terminated that call. So that controller again will launch in the market as soon as we get that final approval. 
 What's happened with all these products that we've introduced over the last couple of years, we've created a lot of product diversification. That's a really good thing. We had so much concentration going back just two and three years ago where 90% of our revenue was based on one really great product, the invisibleSHIELD, that obviously we were at great risk there. 
 As we've grown our revenues and diversified the product line, we look like a very different company today, with the goal of being everything mobile computing, so that we can provide our customers one-stop shopping. If you look at the categories we compete in, whether it's audio or case protection or keyboard, and our competitors are specialists in just those categories, we want to be very competitive in the category that offer one-stop shopping for the retailer where again they can get anything related to mobile computing. 
 Our product strategy has had to change a little bit. We've established product management as a discipline in the organization. Product lifecycles are shortening and devices are coming out every day that we've got to keep pace with. So we've built a team over this last year that can adopt very quickly to this changing market and respond to those kind of lifecycle changes. We're leveraging a lot of market research, some retail data, customer feedback, consumer feedback, and emerging trends to stay ahead of it. 
 When we introduce a product, I'll use this one as an example, this would be introduced on January 6th publicly, and we already have a plan to end-of-life this product and replace it with the next version. And the market is really requiring that so that we don't get into a gross margin compression cycle where we've put out a great product, the competitor has a follow-on product, and all of a sudden gross margin starts compressing. We're being our own worst enemy and end-of-lifing very early and replacing with upgraded versions to try to protect that gross margin. But it causes us to have to turn and burn very quickly. 
 Product management, again I mentioned as a discipline we've had product managers come onboarding this last year to manage each one of these product categories. And they're doing a very good job. And they're kind of like little mini-CEOs over the product category. 
 We've also added some engineering talent that didn't exist in the organization a year ago -- mechanical engineering, electrical, software and so on, all again, for the purpose of creating a one-stop shop for our customers. 
 If we move through this triangle of objectives, you know, we've talked, created product solutions, now moving on to the preferred brand. We're a very young brand. And while we have a lot of credibility today in a buying office, we don't have a lot of retail resonance yet or brand recognition, and it's something that we're working on. 
 How are we doing that? Well, our number one priority is to increase our distribution footprint and allow other brands and our retail partners to endorse our brand by having it on shelf. Number two, we've redesigned packaging to reinforce what the brands represent. We offer products under two brands today, ZAGG and iFrogz -- and I'll explain the difference in just a moment -- but packaging that supports that. 
 Our online awareness, we started as an online company. In our industry of mobile computing accessories, we currently lead in Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, and we're continuing to focus on that. We're leveraging the editorial coverage aggressively when we launch new products, so that there can be some written information for all of you to consume about how we compare with our competition. And again I would encourage you to go out and read the reviews on our iPad Air keyboard versus the competition that's in the market today. 
 This is something that is new to the business going forward, in 2014 we're going to focus more on in-store displays, signage and promotion that drives the consumer to our products rather than our products being discovered by the consumer. And we're going to invest a little bit more there. Also increased involvement in our retailer advertising strategies. We contribute dollars to support them from an ad perspective, but we haven't traditionally been involved in the placement of those ads or how those dollars were being spent, and we're going to get more involved in that. 
 The two brands that we operate under, ZAGG represents about 74% of our revenue, 26% coming from iFrogz. They're differentiated in the fact that ZAGG tends to be very professional oriented, more business tool kind of minded, where iFrogz is very youth oriented. ZAGG is based on executive styling where iFrogz is very trend-driven, changes quickly, moves with the market. ZAGG is priced per quality. That doesn't mean premium, although we've certainly bumped up against some categories, but we're priced for quality, kind of mid-market, whereas iFrogz on the other hand is very value price position. 
 ZAGG has to be strategic when we go into a product line versus iFrogz opportunistic. Again this product that I showed you, this little Bluetooth speaker, is a great iFrogz product -- right price point, it comes in four or five different colors. It's an impulse type of purchase. We can put it in retailers very quickly, a retailer can say, hey, for Valentine's Day, I'd like a red one and a pink one and a white one packaged together, and we can turn on a dime and do those kind of things. 
 The last objective I'm going to talk about is this targeted global distribution. You're not going to be able to read anything in this chart so I'm going to explain it kind of directionally. What we've done here across the x axis on the top, we've listed our product categories. Along the y axis I've listed our current customer base. And anywhere where there's a dark blue box, it indicates that we haven't penetrated that account with that particular product line. So when we talk about maintaining our existing customers, that's certainly important to us, but maybe even more important is selling our complete product line to those customers that already have had experience in the brands and have had good experiences with us as a company. We want to encourage them to carry more of our full product line. So we really become that one-stop shopping that I talked about earlier. 
 Behind that, this third bullet point, we want to close new domestic business and we're doing so with dedicated sales teams that we haven't had in the past. We've had a great hiring phase that we've just gone through, hiring people with relevant prior experience in consumer electronics into some of these channels that we want to open up -- pharmacy, discount clubs, outdoor recreation, travel, home improvement and grocery. 
 And then lastly, we feel like we're poised now to start really growing our international platform. We just hired a new manager in Germany, one in the U.K., one in France, another that's covering Latin America, and an overall vice president position over international sales. 
 We had too, this year, was quite a learning experience for us. We had grown up in a very entrepreneurial environment where we had hot products and our sales team was probably -- could be characterized more as taking orders than actually selling. And so there were some skill sets that hadn't been established or brought in to the organization. So we've just recently hired four new account managers. We've hired a new domestic wholesale and franchise manager of our business. I talked a little bit about some of the international hires, and then engaged some sales training to help those members of our team that again grew up with the business that perhaps didn't have all the skill sets we needed to continue to grow the business where we needed to go. And then we've got a higher -- we've still got an open position rather for a new EVP of sales and a couple of other account managers. 
 We also stepped and acted and looked at the compensation and those things that would motivate people and drive people in a selling organization realize that we were a little bit off-target, and we restructured the comp recently. We also engaged revenue acceleration consultancy that's been in our office now for about a month and a half, final reports are due next week, but preliminary draft was extremely helpful in identifying the near-term opportunities and where we should have the business focus. So we're looking forward to implementing some of those recommendations. 
 Very quickly through the income statement, I think the takeaway here, obviously we've had revenue contraction over this past year. It really hurt us in the first quarter, you can see that in our adjusted EBITDA margin being compressed significantly. We've worked very hard in the second and third quarters to return the business to a level of consistent EBITDA generation, which has not been easy, frankly, because in this period of revenue contraction, we've had to really focus on the operational side of the business and fine-tune and tweak some things. 
 I hope the message that it sends is that we've become decent operators. We're in a period where if we get the top line moving again, we're in a very good place to leverage some of that. 
 Guidance on the year, we've got some revenue at $212 million to $218 million, gross margins in the low 40s, and adjusted EBITDA at 37.5 to 39.5. We're very comfortable with that guidance. And I think that -- is there anything else -- no. 
 Move on to the balance sheet. What I would tell you here, and I've said it a couple of times now, we have generated -- we're generating a lot of cash from operations. We've got a $60 million line of credit that we've now used with Wells Fargo. Total debt is down to $18 million. We've reduced it by $26 million this year. Our effective interest rate is less than 1%. And again we've generated cash during a period of revenue decline. We've got $13 million of cash on the balance sheet. 
 Again this is one of those charts that's going to be very difficult for you to see from where you're sitting, but enterprise value to EBITDA generation versus our peers were at about a 50% discount today. So the stock is discounted by that perspective and we're continuing to generate a lot of cash. 
 Why invest? Why now? 
 First of all, we do have a strong leadership position in both brands in emerging market rather in mobile computing. We're focused on some very high-growth categories right now -- mobile gaming into 2014, we're putting a lot of emphasis in the keyboard, input tools, and those where we've got some strength, and refreshing our invisibleSHIELD product line. 
 We're introducing new products, I'd mentioned, consistent product launch time to begin the selling process earlier. Even though, you know, I told you this product won't hit the market officially until January, we've been out selling it to our retailers for some time now to have pick-up on day one. 
 New sales executives, expanding both our domestic and international distribution into 2014, inventory controls are improving, and we've really worked hard to lower the debt and we're generating sufficient cash to grow the business. 
 So I think with that, I've seen the five minutes time flashed, I'm going to open it up for Q&amp;A. We also have our CFO here with us with me.

   Juniper Networks, Inc. (JNPR) Credit Suisse 2013 Annual Technology Conference December  4, 2013  5:00 PM ET 
 Kulbinder Garcha - Credit Suisse 
 Okay. I’m glad. We will get started. I’m very pleased to have from Juniper, Robyn Denholm and Kathleen from IR and (inaudible) or perhaps forward-looking statements and then we will go into some Q&amp;A and some presentation. 
 Kathleen Nemeth 
 Thank you, Kulbinder. And good afternoon and welcome everyone. And welcome to those of you who are joining us on today’s webcast. We're delighted to be here. I do want to point out that during our discussion today whether in the presentation that Robyn walks through or through the discussion that we have with Kulbinder, we may make forward-looking statements. There are risks and uncertainties associated with those statements. For a full list please see our most recent 10-Q filed with the SEC. 
 With that, I will turn it over to Robyn. 
 Robyn Denholm 
 Thanks Kathleen. So I was going to go through a few things this morning. Firstly, I just -- oh, this afternoon actually. I was just going to go through the strategy overview. Many of you have seen this before. But basically, as a company what we are focused on is, using the technology from our Routing, Switching and Security businesses into both the service provider and the enterprise market. 
 And the enterprise market, we go after the customers in those markets that most resemble the ones that are in our service provider market. We're also in seven domains of the network, which are listed here, Access &amp; Aggregation, CORE, EDGE and also the Data Center as well as the WAN and the Campus &amp; Branch and also on the security side in the consumer and embedded area. 
 In terms of how the business is evolving in terms of SDN and NVF, we put this slide together to sort of help people understand what is going on from our perspective. So if you look at the different layers of the network. There are certain layers within the network that are actually focused more around the scale, performance and reliability of the network. So making sure that packets in the network aren't dropped on the floor or actually make it to their destination et cetera and also coping with the throughput and volume of traffic that’s happening. 
 And then there is areas in the networks that are actually more about virtualization and scalability but also the agility and time to market of services. And the way we look at our business is between software system and silicons and our core technologies in those areas that’s how we look at the market evolving over time from both an SDN and an NVF perspective. 
 So if you look at routing and switching those in terms of the way we look at it really help with the scale, performance and reliability and security is the type of application as well as things like low balancing, et cetera that reside in the top part. 
 So in terms of results, we've had five quarters of year-over-year growth and that growth is accelerating in terms of our performance year-to-date. If you look at out year-to-date performance from a earnings perspective, we are up over 50% in terms of expansion in our earnings. We also have had very good demand metrics. For the third quarter; our book-to-bill was greater than one. And our backlog is at a healthy levels as well as our deferred revenue growing quarter-over-quarter. 
 In terms of uses of cash and sources of cash, I've put this chart together to help explain how we are viewing our capital allocation policy. So if you look from the beginning of 2008 through to the end of last quarter, we have actually generated about $4.6 billion of cash, obviously some of that is onshore and offshore, uses of cash we have actually had capital purchases of about $1.3 billion over that period of time and $600 million worth of M&amp;A. From a cash perspective, obviously, there is some equity involved in those M&amp;A transaction. And then we've repurchased about $1.9 billion worth of shares. We've brought the share count down over that period of time as we have also continued to use stock from an incentive program perspective with our employees and as I said also used some stock to deliver on our M&amp;A. There are $4 billion of cash that’s on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter. 40% is onshore which is about $1.6 billion and 60% is actually offshore. 
 And so I wanted to just summarize from a strategy position. Our strategy is very focused around growing our revenue. Our differentiation is in software systems and in silicon from a company perspective. We continue to focus on driving earnings growth through not only revenue growth but also our prudent management of our OpEx as we move forward. And then we do generate cash wealth as a business and we are very thoughtful in our capital allocation approach. That was it.

AVGO," 
   Avago Technologies Limited (AVGO) Q4 2013 Earnings Call December  4, 2013  5:00 PM ET 
 Operator 
 Welcome to the Avago Technologies Limited Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2013 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Tom Krause, Vice President of Corporate Development. Please go ahead, sir. 
 Thomas Krause 
 Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are Hock Tan, President and CEO; and Tony Maslowski, Chief Financial Officer of Avago Technologies. After the market closed today, Avago distributed a press release and financial tables describing our financial performance for the fourth quarter fiscal year 2013. If you did not receive a copy, you may obtain the information from the Investors section of Avago's website at avagotech.com. This conference call is being webcast live, and a recording will be available via telephone playback for one week. It will also be archived in the Investors section of our website. 
 During the prepared comments section of this call, Hock and Tony will be providing details of our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2013 results, background to our 2014 outlook and some commentary regarding the business environment. We will take questions after the end of our prepared comments. 
 In addition to U.S. GAAP reporting, Avago reports certain financial measures on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to today's press release. Comments made during today's call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP financial results. Please refer to our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for information on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call. 
 At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Hock Tan. Hock? 
 Hock E. Tan 
 Thank you, Tom. Good afternoon, everyone. We're going to start today by reviewing our market business highlights, and then Tony will provide a summary of fourth quarter and fiscal 2013 financial results. 
 Revenue from our fourth quarter fiscal year was $738 million, represented an increase of 15% from last quarter and an increase of 19% from the same quarter a year ago. Sequential increase was at the upper end of our guidance, which was 12% to 15% growth. To perhaps provide you with some further comparability to last quarter in which CyOptics only contributed about 5 weeks of revenues, our total non-CyOptics revenue grew 8% from last quarter. 
 During Q4, wireless was very strong, driven by major product ramps and our large smartphone OEM customers. Wired infrastructure was up 22% sequentially, primarily due to a full quarter of revenue contribution from CyOptics. These more than offset the weaker-than-expected industrial revenue, which ended up with a sequential decline of 4%. Let me now provide more color in each of our target markets, starting with wireless. 
 Revenue from wireless came in above expectation, growing 19% sequentially and represented 47% of our total revenues. Sequential strength was driven primarily by strong product ramps, as I mentioned earlier, and our 2 largest OEM customers. As you may have seen from the independent third-party teardowns, our content in both of these platforms improved substantially compared to prior generations. As a result of the proliferation of LTE today and the challenges in RF designs, our proprietary FBAR filter and integrated front-end module have proliferated in many smartphones. We see this trend continuing to drive our wireless business over the next few generations. 
 Now looking into Q1 of fiscal 2014. We expect strong demand from our 2 major smartphone OEM customers to sustain and be only partially offset by the seasonal weakness at other OEMs. As a result, we expect overall wireless revenue to be flat, perhaps maybe even slightly down in Q1. 
 Moving on to wired infrastructures. Wired revenue, as I mentioned, grew 22% sequentially, represented 33% of overall revenues. Our non-CyOptics wired revenue was up single digits after a pronounced 18% sequential growth in Q3. Data center-related demand continues to be strong, particularly for our 40-gigabit-per-second fiber optical products. However, our ASIC service business paused temporarily after a record high during Q3 due primarily from inventory adjustment with major OEMs. Meanwhile, demand for CyOptics Indium Phosphide based optical components was strong due to an uptick in 100G coherent telecom networks and 40G single-mode long reach interconnects in large data centers. 
 Looking forward to Q1, however, we expect that sustained strength in data center spending in 40G will be partially offset by a pause in carrier routing spending in China. In this Q1 also, we begin to convert the low margin module revenue in China to relate to the high-margin component sales as part of our transformation of the CyOptics business model out of the telecoms in our module infrastructure. Accordingly, we anticipate wired infrastructure revenue to decline mid-single digits on a percentage basis compared with Q4. 
 Switching gears to industrial, during Q4, worldwide industrial resales were down mid-single digits, driven particularly by softness in China and Japan. Europe and North America, however, remained relatively flat. The decline in China resales reflect that, I should say, restocking by Chinese OEMs during the preceding quarter and showed very much a characteristic volatility of Chinese OEM customers. No surprise, therefore, our industrial sales declined 4% in Q4 and represented about 20% of our overall revenues. Looking forward into Q1, we expect seasonal weakness globally. We will continue to reduce inventory into our distribution channels as we have done so last quarter. Accordingly, we anticipate revenue from industrial to decline mid-single digits too on a percentage basis compared to the preceding quarter. 
 With this, in summary, I would -- let me recap. Q4 was strong, product ramps in wireless and strong fiber demand in data center buildout and telecoms infrastructure. Q4 -- in Q1 that we're in, we expect demand in wireless to sustain, but year-end seasonal weakness in enterprise spending, as well as industrial, will drive 3% to 6% sequential revenue decline. However, on a year-over-year basis, we expect the trend in our business -- in our major businesses, to remain solid, with a projected high-single digit year-on-year growth for Q1, even without the benefit -- even without the accretion of CyOptics. 
 With that, let me now turn the call over to Tony for a more detailed review of our fourth quarter and full year 2013 financials. 
 Anthony Maslowski 
 Thank you, Hock, and good afternoon, everyone. Before reviewing the fourth quarter and fiscal 2013 financial results, I want to remind you that my comments today will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP data is included with the earnings release issued today and is also available on our website at www.avagotech.com. 
 Revenue of $738 million in Q4 represents an increase of 15% from last quarter and an increase of 19% compared to the same quarter a year ago. The better-than-expected sequential growth was a result of stronger demand from both wireless and wired infrastructure target markets. Revenue from our industrial target market was below our prior expectation, primarily due to weaker-than-expected distribution resales. In the quarter, Foxconn continued to be a greater than 10% customer. 
 Our Q4 gross margin was 50.5%, 50 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance. Gross margins improved in specific product categories, offsetting total unfavorable product mix. 
 Turning to operating expenses, OpEx for Q4 came in at $144 million, in line with our guidance. R&amp;D expenses increased by $8 million to $99 million, primarily due to full quarter R&amp;D spending for CyOptics. SG&amp;A decreased by $1 million to $45 million. As a percentage of sales, R&amp;D decreased to 13% from 14% in the prior quarter. And similarly, SG&amp;A decreased to 6% from 7% of net revenue. 
 Income from operations for the quarter increased by $38 million sequentially to $229 million and represented 31% of net revenue. Compared to $199 million for Q4 of last year, income from operations increased by $30 million. We recorded a net gain of $11 million in other income, primarily due to a gain in fair value of marketable securities representing minority investments. 
 Taxes came in at $13 million for Q4, slightly above our guidance. Q4 net income of $227 million increased 21% from the prior quarter. In Q4, earnings per diluted share of $0.89 was $0.15 higher than Q3. The sequential increase in Q4 earnings is attributable primarily to the full quarter earnings contribution from CyOptics, as well as higher revenue from non-CyOptic businesses. Compared to Q4 of last year, net income was $33 million higher, and earnings per diluted share was 12% higher for similar reasons. 
 I'd like to point out that Q4 2013 marked the record highs for revenue, operating income, as well as net income. Our share-based compensation in Q4 was $22 million. The breakdown of expense for Q4 includes $3 million in cost of goods sold, $8 million in R&amp;D and $11 million in SG&amp;A. In Q1 2014, we anticipate share-based compensation will be approximately $24 million. And just as a reminder, the company's definition of non-GAAP net income excludes share-based compensation expense. 
 Moving on to the balance sheet, our day sales outstanding came in flat at 52 days compared to the prior quarter. Timing of shipments in the quarter and unfavorable impact of CyOptics DSO continued to weigh on Avago's total DSO. Our inventory ended at $285 million, a slight increase of $1 million from last quarter. Our wireless inventory remained at the elevated level in anticipation of continued strength from one of our large smartphone OEM customers. 
 Days on hand were 71 days, which decreased 11 days from Q3, given the much higher revenue during the quarter. We also took the opportunity in Q4, given the favorable credit market, to resize our revolving credit facility. As you have seen, we've entered into a new credit agreement providing for a revolving credit facility with an aggregate principal of up to $575 million with an ability to increase it to $675 million compared to our previous $300 million facility. 
 We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $985 million, and we generated $212 million in operational cash flow. Just to foreshadow Q1 a bit for you, Q1 is a generally weaker quarter for cash generation due to the payment of our annual employee bonuses relating to the prior fiscal year. We spent $57 million on capital expenditures, this was below our guidance for the quarter, mainly because of the timing of equipment delivery. For Q1, we expect CapEx to be approximately $63 million. 
 During the quarter, we repurchased 852,000 shares, which consumed $33 million of cash. On September 30, 2013, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per ordinary share, which consumed $57 million of cash. This dividend was raised by $0.02 from the prior quarter. Since the inception of our dividend program in Q2 of 2011 to date, we have continued to increase our dividend each quarter. 
 Now let me briefly recap our fiscal 2013 full year results. Revenue increased by 7% to $2.52 billion, mainly driven by the strength in our wireless business. Avago's overall gross margin decreased by nearly 20 basis points to 50.8% as compared to 51% for fiscal 2012. Net income for fiscal 2013 increased to $731 million, or $2.89 per diluted share, as compared to $700 million, or $2.77 per diluted share, in fiscal 2012. 
 Now let me turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2014. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions, and we do not intend to update this guidance. Total revenue is expected to be down in the range of 3% to 6% from Q4. Gross margin is expected to be 50.5% plus or minus 1 percentage point. Operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $145 million. Taxes are forecasted to be approximately $10 million. And finally, the diluted share count forecast is for 257 million shares. 
 That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.

YHOO," 
   Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) Credit Suisse Technology Conference Call December  4, 2013  3:15 PM ET 
 Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse 
 Alright. So I think we are going to go ahead and get started. I am Stephen Ju with the Credit Suisse internet equity research team. We are joined by Ken Goldman, CFO of Yahoo! So without much further ado, let’s get started. So Ken, you have been at Yahoo! for over a year now, so how do you feel about the progress the company has made to-date? And what are some of the encouraging signs that you have seen? And what are the areas of focus now? 
 Ken Goldman 
 Yes. And just before I start, let me do my little disclaimer that I may, I will try to keep that actually from saying too many forward-looking statements, but I may say forward-looking statements as I would ask everyone to refer to the risk factors in our various public filings, 10-Qs and 10-K and so forth. Yes, it’s amazing how time just fly in terms of the past year. Many of us started – well, let me just go back which Marissa started in July ‘12 and several of us came on board during the second half of last year. I did not know Marissa, I was referred in by a mutual friend and he has been – it’s hard to explain how much has changed. The good news is the core Yahoo! was there. The engagement was there. On the products, even though we had let them atrophy so to speak were there, but the company has been really fundamentally reengaged, re-enthused. We brought on a number of new folks. The team now I would argue is working very well together. We are working very well with the board that as you know has not always been the case at Yahoo! and Marissa has been phenomenal in terms of number of changes that she has made. 
 We have a rigorous employee review system. We have a rigorous goal setting system. We have various communication devices such as an all hands meeting every Friday and late afternoon, which people told her, no one would ever show up and it’s standing room only, it’s late afternoon when we have those meetings. Things that you would think are simple in a company, in a company that has been around for 18 years you would have, but we didn’t have a very rigorous approval matrix. That’s sort of bread and butter for me. So we spent a lot of time making sure we have a very rigorous approval matrix. And we did things to really be much more internet centric in terms of employees whether it’s everyone has the latest phones, laptops, tablets, food and all that good stuff. 
 The thing that surprised me is we really didn’t have a business rhythm like I like to have. In other words, normal meetings reviewing the metrics, the business, the revenue, we didn’t have a lot of the operational meetings. We spent much of late last year and really much of early this year getting our metrics in place. So we really now understand the drivers of the business, the revenue drivers and so we have consistency in terms of how we look at that whether its understanding that we now see very well daily revenue and all the different components. We see the core metrics in terms of clicks, pricing and so forth, ads sold, sell-through rate, all these things that we now can see, we see how much is booked for the quarter as we know how we stand at any point in time, how we booked this quarter as vis-à-vis prior quarter. So we have a bunch of data that we now use to run the business that honestly didn’t exist before. So that has been sort of the blocking and tackling is where lot of this year was predicated on. 
 And then the other thing I would say is Marissa really went about, once we got the teams in place to really reengineer the products if you will. And so I think about 15, at least 15 of our products have been totally updated from things like mail to sports, finance, homepage and so forth because many cases hadn’t been updated for a number of years, so all of that had to be done. And so as I think about where we are today, we are feeling very, very good about that. A year ago, we had no mobile activity. It’s hard to believe that. We had no mobile activity. It’s the biggest tectonic shift that any of us will have gone through in the internet. We now have that. So that’s looking much more a great progress there. So with all of that as we think about now going into ‘14 we think we feel very, very well positioned. And I know I have related questions there, but I just want to give an overview there. 
 Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse 
 Got you. So you brought up the mobile strategy, so the mobile engineering talent acquisition is definitely very easy to understand, but can you help us stitch together the acquisitions to-date and how they helped your engagement in product development. And Marissa brought up I think when she first got there the daily habits you wake up, you look at the news, you look at the whether, so where else does Yahoo! need to be in order to increase its share of the consumer’s time? 
 Ken Goldman 
 I think the – we have the core there and so whether it’s news I happen to like sports, finance many of you in this room whether mail, though there is various entertainment products which you may not wake up early in the morning but serve as a daily habit. We think games, is an area of interest. So there are a number of things that we already had, but honestly had not been - two things. Either they had not been upgraded for long time or hadn’t been repurposed for the mobile side, so both of those have been done. And so today when we go into where we are today to go into ’15 we now look at products that have been upgraded much more viewed for today’s world, repurposed if you will for mobile. So mobile whether its smartphone or tablet it’s very, very important and that’s where our page – that’s where the growth of our page views are coming, so all of that is there. 
 The way we have added several other people in mobile by and large many of those people have come through our acquisitions. We have done something like 25 acquisitions roughly in the last year. The bulk of those are in the mobile space is one of the things we have to do bootstrap our way up to get into mobile. We didn’t have a team in place. We just didn’t have teams in place a year ago. We are now there again I think as we get into ’14 we will provide more metrics on our mobile and both in terms of engagement and revenue and so forth .But suffice it to say we get a very, very good growth in mobile and the increase in our pages is primarily coming from the mobile side where we are trying to hold these desktops relatively flattish to it may go down a bit in desktop, but frankly all the growth is going to come from the mobile side. 
 Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse 
 So we are going to keep this interactive. So we will open it up to the floor for questions at any given time. So while we are pulling for question now I have got another one here. So I am curious about your online video strategy since this is one segment of display that’s seeing a real shortage of available inventory right now. So what are you going to be doing to help the brand advertisers, move their TV dollars online? 
 Ken Goldman 
 That’s a good question because that has been one of the challenges we have. And frankly there are certain things, that I would say very straight is still work in progress for our company. Video is one again I feel a lot better. We are a lot further along on mobile and we can look at the trends in mobile and feel very good about our position for ’14, ’15. Video, we have work to do still. We have done various things in terms of alignment with NBC Sports, ABC News, SNL, Comedy Central, CNBC and so forth. We have done a variety of things there. We have some of our own programs as well that we use on screen. But I think to get more direct content, more must-see content is very important to us. We are going to work on that. We believe in that. 
 We brought on Katie Couric obviously is very well known news caster. We think she can do some things that are very unique for us in term of creating content for us specifically, exclusive content that you would come to Yahoo! to see. We did a little while ago we hosted four rock concerts if you will. Again, another way you come see us. So we are trying to do a lot of things that this brings people in. We will have obviously we have a relationship with NBC Sports for the Olympics coming in I think February. So there are things of that nature that will bring people in. 
 I don’t want to say must see, but things that really draw people in, that’s the focus is going to be. Well, I try to like – people always ask the question how are you different and why would people – what is Yahoo! versus others. We do have what I call – what we call you just see in the industry user generated content. So a lot of it clearly mail is of that sort and so forth which is clearly where we have much of our viewership comes from if you will. But on the other hand we are unique from the other and that we have the homepage in news. We have our own sports. We have weather. We have finance. So we have a lot of things that content that people come to daily that you wouldn’t get it from Twitter or Facebook and again so we will look at that as just like maybe competing for time spent, but competing really for different kinds of content than we would have at Yahoo! So that’s what we have been known for. People come to our homepage, they see News, going from there see maybe Sports, the Finance, Weather, obviously Mail, all of the things are very, very important and videos and screen and some of the unique content we have, that’s what people want to come to Yahoo! for. 
 Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse 
 Got you. Are there any other specific tactical areas that you feel you should want to highlight for investment? And of course carried in this question is your view on capital allocation and what you feel is the optimal level of cash for Yahoo! especially in light of the recent convert deal? 
 Ken Goldman 
 Let me – I will answer that question I know I saw some hands out. And so I always like to keep this free-flowing and interactive and again see what’s on your folks’ mind, but yes, I think the – obviously, I was very pleased with the ability to raise some money what I proceed is very, very attractive rates. For those who know me, I am – historically I have not been a big fan of converse per se, but I just felt that the timing was right, the terms were very good. It was a way for us to raise the money at very, very – what I felt was very attractive rates. And to buttress that with our announcement of big buyback again, I think the world has evolved in technology. There is a period of time when – I have been doing this for long time where we always want to have more and more cash even if it didn’t necessarily have a direct purpose. I think today having proper capital allocation is an important element of running any company and certainly in our space. I know the board feels that way, I feel that way, management feels that way. So we think long and hard about how to have the right capital allocation, given we do want to have a strong balance sheet. So there is a level of cash. The fact that said roughly $3 billion, I don’t have that exact right number, but roughly $3 billion is the number we feel good about having on our balance sheet to show strength, exhibit strength. 
 On the other hand, we have bought back over the last couple – around two years, about 250 million shares, not quite 25% of our capital structure. So today, we have a little over billion shares outstanding. We had well over 1.2 billion about two years ago. So capital allocation and doing that well is very important to us, we think about that. And it’s one of my jobs in terms of working with the board and how best to. In the past, how best to apportion the money from Alibaba, but also how best to think about free cash flow and how to use free cash flow. And there is various ways to do it. One of which is to be thoughtful in terms of buying back stock in which we are. 
 Another one is to use some of that for generally modest size acquisitions, which we will think about capital spending. So if you think about free cash flow, there is obviously EBITDA, which drives it. There is two other things that are important. One is cash for capital expenditures and then tax – cash for taxes and we spend a lot of time in both of those. So capital spending, if you look at our capital expenditures down about 40% from what it was last year. It’s pretty much a low for the last several years. And so we have much more rigorous approaches to how we spend capital. We have very rigorous approach to how we think about tax planning, how we spend not only the rate, but how we spend cash for taxes. So I think we are doing all of the things you would want as investors for us to do, you think about how to properly use our cash. 
 Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse 
 Over the past two quarters, I have noticed you guys have had a pretty sizable increase in terms of the amount of clicks coming through your web pages. Given that you guys are an ad company at the end of the day, how long like how much of a lag is there between click-throughs continuing to increase and where you actually do gain some pricing power in the market? 
 Ken Goldman 
 Yes, the question, so as we think about over time, clearly the fact that our click-throughs have been up high-teens 20%, 21%, year-over-year is good. Pricing has been down a smidge if you will. As we think about planning, we clearly would like to see – we would like to see ourselves do better on pricing. So that is a real important element to how we think about the future and pricing by the way really across the boards. And so as we get a better handle on our inventory, better handle on our ability to sell, add more advertisers think about premium advertising and premium spots versus programmatic if you will. We think about that relative to both search, display and especially mobile. We think as we think about next year as more and more of our growth will clearly come from mobile, how do we think about the ads sold there, how do we think about native ads and how do we think about pricing for that. That is going to be a focus for us in ‘14. 
 Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse 
 Can you talk about the philosophy behind the hiring of Katie Couric and what’s view is in competing directly with traditional media and whether there is any kind of evidence to support that you could do that or how this decision was made? 
 Ken Goldman 
 Yes, I think the question about Katie Couric we will see. It’s just without giving numbers is the modest-sized bet for us that we think the more we have unique exclusive content that drives people to our site that can’t get otherwise we think is important. It does – so there is one element of a halo effect and more important element of the content, the pages and the monetization they are on. We think whether its Katie, having Megan Liberman do some of the be the editor at large, having David Pogue on the technology side and others of that sort where we can have content you can’t get otherwise. We are looking for other opportunities by the way. 
 We think that’s the way to draw people to our sites and as you buy from data we had now more people go on to the net than watching TV. We think that’s we and by the way Katie think because she has been very public about this think that’s the wave of the future. I don’t think is necessarily where it means TV has to go down for us to win per se. But we do Yahoo! has always stood for our unique content having our own access. So we will combine things like Katie if you will to using Associate Press which we have. So we will have a lot of informational sources. We use Routers for finance and a bunch of other sites, information sites. So we are going to use – we want to be comprehensive so you can go people who come to our site they can get everything they want without having – without forcing them to go somewhere else. So that’s – that is going to be one of the things we continue to do and frankly it’s going to evolve. It’s going to evolve over time. 
 Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse 
 So I will have another one here. So I mean going back to the capital allocation question, I mean you have pretty significant M&amp;A activity in 2013. I think you mentioned about 25 companies you acquired, so what does the New Year hold for you and how does your criteria for acquisition change next year if at all? 
 Ken Goldman 
 I think there is a variety of things at least I think of. One is my sense is we will continue to be aggressive, but maybe a little less number in terms of what we call (indiscernible). It was a unique situation that occurred in ’13 where we came in we have recognized we were behind if you will in the mobile in terms of having technology we need and frankly some other areas that we need to have technology even in our mail area. So we made some acquisitions of folks to really bootstrap our technology and our capabilities. I think we are well along the way there, so I don’t want to say we are going to stop because I am not saying that but I think that will slowdown in terms of some of those that we just had to do if you will to get us in the position we are now that given where we were about a year ago. 
 I think in terms of larger ones we did look at some things internationally. I think the challenge for us internationally is we are sub-scale. We want to go long and hard and supply around 5-ish countries in Europe, so we have to drive that hard. But frankly Europe now is if you look at our numbers is less than 10% of our business. It needs to be – prior than that our whole international business was 25% roughly in Q3. We need to grow that something that we can do organically but we are going to have to think about inorganically as well. I have always liked the term of revenue growth accretive and so I would like to find acquisitions that for a good price if you will allow us to grow accretively. 
 We are all about growing, unfortunately this you if you look at it historically it has been flat as you can get not where we would have liked. I’ll just say that I mean we certainly went into the year with a little bit better expectations than we have achieved in the first three quarters. And so as we think about finishing this year and ’14 clearly all of our sites are on revenue and growing in the top line, that’s all of the sites to do that is going to be on the mobile side. The other thing and relative to international, we do spend frankly, we had to get our house in order domestically first. We are very confident we made great strides there and now we want to take that capability and transition that to the international. So we have put lot more emphasis on the international. So you will see that as we go forward here into ‘014. So I just honestly feel so much better today. I mean, you come in as some of us were new, some of us are already there, you go through a budgeting process in ‘13 frankly you don’t know what you don’t know. We have had a sense for what works, what frankly didn’t work as well as we would have liked. And so we have a much better ability to plan. We know the metrics. We have put the metrics in place. So I think we go into ‘14 in much, much better position from a product point of view, from business case point of view, rhythm point of view and how to really drive the business. 
 Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse 
 Yes. You talked about putting systems in place to get better data on inventory and pricing. Can you talk about what are you doing to get better data on your uses in order to improve targeting those advertisers? 
 Ken Goldman 
 So your question is, what are we doing better on users and targeting? 
 Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse 
 You are getting better data around the users and then monetizing that? 
 Ken Goldman 
 Yes, I think actually there we have had good data in general. I think, we haven’t always acted on the data as much as we could have from what I can see. And so we are doing lot more of that today. So we are targeting – we are doing it across frankly all of the platforms and I already talked about was desktop and being able to by the way to sell across the platform to sell across. Another way of thinking about it is we now look at a homepage is a big part of what you sell and knowing exactly go into a quarter what’s been sold, what hasn’t been sold, who would want to buy on a Thursday, for example, because they have movie permits going on Friday and Saturday. So you want to sell that much better in terms of focusing on this past weekend and who want the advertiser in that. So we have a much better feel for A, our users targeting them, knowing the advertisers, knowing the ones that should that. And so we have that much more focus all the way up from the sales infrastructure, all the way up to frankly, Marissa and Henrique and so forth. So that is in place. That may have been done at a lower level a year ago, but we certainly didn’t have the visibility at senior team on those kinds of things I just mentioned that we do have today. So as we go into a period, we know exactly what’s been sold, what hasn’t been sold, what days are open, what days aren’t open, what days we should sell it to X, Y, Z, because this happens to be a data they want to. It’s a good day for them to go to sell sales. We will have the Olympics coming up, how do we think about that relative to car companies or anybody else much better capability today that maybe it might have existed one-time, I really don’t know, I don’t know the history. It certainly wasn’t prevalent as best we could tell when many of us came in a year ago. 
 Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse 
 
 Got it. So look and feel about your verticals, including the homepage on some of the other sites, have gone to the endless feed format and do you feel like you have to reeducate all of your advertisers to work with a new format or have others kind of paved the path in terms of selling advertisers on the new format? 
 Ken Goldman 
 Yes, that’s an interesting perspective, because I would just say, I would say a little differently clearly as we have changed some ad format, changed some of the products, we actually in some cases eliminated some spots where we had ads before, because they were very, I don’t know great, but they created a lot of friction with our users in terms of how they got into our sites. We had some cases where you couldn’t get into your Mail at all without seeing an ad first. So we have done some things, which you could argue may have been near term not helpful, but long-term, it does help our engagement. Sometimes, you bring on new products. It is on new formats. The advertisers have to get used to it. So we have had probably a little bit more of that this year that we may have in the future. I think that’s primarily behind us. And again, we have done so much so fast and then bring everyone along has been some work if you will. But I think as we go on, I think my sense is there will be the change is going at least for a while will be more evolutionary than some of the changes that were more revolutionary this past year, as we just had to go, make things happen very, very quickly. Because again some of these products from what I see internally hadn’t been updated 3, 4 in some cases believe or not 8, 9 years. Groups is one product that hadn’t been updated in 8, 9 years. So lot of products that we were more of a media sort of oriented company I guess. We let the development side and products side which is hard technology wither if you will the number of engineers we had in the company, number of PhDs had withered or declined until we actually got rid of them. So we changed the course of that and my sense is that is probably 80%, 90% behind us in terms of getting where we want to be and now it’s more evolutionary going forward. 
 Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse 
 So it seems like the products are in place from how do you feel about your display business overall in getting that back to growth trajectory? 
 Ken Goldman 
 Well, I think the – as we think about it – as we go through our planning now for next year I mean we are very focused there, I mean we have pricing going down now I mean do we want – so we wanted – we like to see and again I am not giving an forecast there. We definitely would like to see pricing improve, so we are going to be focused on things like the ads sold, sell through rates, pricing ad formats. We are going to be looking at growth and frankly try to make improvements along all of those metrics. We clearly know it’s going to be hard to grow pages in the PC desktop as we know, I mean you know the numbers just like I know the numbers in terms of PCs sold and so forth. So the real growth and we are looking – we are going to be focused on real growth. We are seeing great growth in mobile. Again we are looking for continuation of those trends in mobile that’s where all the things I just said, so where there is native ad formats whether it’s a better sell through rate, we think pricing has a long way to go to be improved. We have focus in all those things that’s where we see growth coming in ’14. 
 Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse 
 Theoretically the native ad formats should be performing equally as well in whichever the modality or consumer access whether it’s desktop, mobile or tablet, so over the longer term how do you think these – that format will perform? 
 Ken Goldman 
 We think it’s going to perform quite well. I mean it’s such an – I don’t want to say natural because it’s a play of words but it is a natural, it’s less obtrusive for the user. We see much better click – we generally see better click-through rates. It’s just as a greater format again you don’t see these big display ads in the right or left just sort of blaring at you. And I hate to admit it, but I actually see these ads when I am coming up with – driving my Tesla. So I can watch easily it’s just much, it’s just A, more readable an less obtrusive much more interesting and so work in the ads – working ads is very, very important. The dynamics of ads, the kind of ads, the formatting of ads it’s a science in and itself beyond the content. So yes we are very, very focused on that. 
 Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse 
 Okay, switching a little bit to the search side for a second here. So that’s on pretty steady growth over the past year, is there still more opportunity or room for growth in the coming year? 
 Ken Goldman 
 Yes, I think in the search side the things we have to do there it’s like again I am sounding a little bit broken record here. But we can continue to do things on the desktop side. Particularly we think on the pricing side. But honestly it’s like everything else. I think the two areas in this case is going to be mobile. And down the road we have work to do but down the road on Tumblr that’s an area where we think there is a big opportunity for search as well as display for that matter. So we do need to work with Tumblr to monetize that those pages and so forth. But again I think in the mobile side and then international we basically treading water – as I said before treading water internationally we need to grow international. We need to see greater pages pricing there as well. 
 Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse 
 Okay, got you. So you have been spending a lot of time shoring up your U.S. operations and you brought up your international operations. So I mean what’s the time when Yahoo! had a pretty wider footprint in terms of geography. So what’s going to be your – that was probably before you got there. Yes, it’s been a while, but…? 
 Ken Goldman 
 I guess I have missed that. 
 Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse 
 You may some how but yes, so what’s going to be your go to market strategy for international how is that going to be dealt? 
 Ken Goldman 
 Again I think the – what we have done is as we have updated the products this year they were primarily U.S. centric. So we are going to take a lot of those capabilities and now which we hadn’t done up until now transition those or transfer those to international. We are going to spend more time on driving content, acquiring content internationally. Again we can’t be all things to all people, so we are going to initially focus on the five or so core countries in Europe, several core countries in Asia-Pacific. Again, I think the things we can do even further with Yahoo! Japan and think about how to leverage that. We are very strong in areas like Taiwan and Hong Kong put more emphasis there. The countries in Europe and again I think there we have sort of just start somewhere and show some incremental improvement. The other thing is I mentioned before we will look at somebody said there maybe opportunistic acquisitions, but we will be in lookout, in our lookout for acquisitions, because some of this to get to the level from the level we are now to a more meaningful presence in Europe in particular, we are going to have to do some things that are not just more of the same. 
 Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse 
 Understood. So I mean, you mentioned Tumblr earlier, so we haven’t heard from that team a little while, but I mean, how is that integration progressing and are there specific areas we can see a lot of potential for monetization? 
 Ken Goldman 
 Yes. We haven’t updated the metrics on the ones you can see on their site. So we will start updating some of that data as the year goes – as this year finishes up and as we go into ‘14, but the engagement has been good. The growth there is good. We are at a transition now of focusing more and more on the revenue side of that equation. That hadn’t been the case before we acquired the company and they get into that transition both on display side as well as the search side. And we have a very good rapport with David Karp and his team. So it’s a question of yes, we are leaving them to run it independently, but they are part of our company. So we are working to make sure we get leverage in synergies between what Tumblr is doing and what we are doing here. So I think that’s going to continue to evolve and we will continue to see more success there, if you will. And we do expect those revenues to be meaningful to us next year and certainly more meaningful as the years go on. So there is nothing I would say today that says we don’t feel very, very good about where we are in Tumblr. Does take work, it’s not easy to take a site, which basically has had no monetization to transition to monetizing and figure out how to do that in a way that does not obstruct users, does not infringe on how they think about their site and so forth. So you have to be careful to do that in a way that again is constructive and positive for both the medium and longer term which is what, so that’s how we think about working with them. 
 Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse 
 Yes. So I mean that begs the question of native ads for me at least in my head once again, I mean, it’s mostly text-based right now, there are some pictures interspersed in with the native ads. So is there a potential especially in a case like Tumblr to show pictures or even video in some cases? 
 Ken Goldman 
 There might be. Again, this is all areas that we have worked with them on. And so it’s still little early there. We are in sort of the planning stages now with them. So yet I think all of those things are opportunities. David Karp has such a nat sense of what works and what might not work with his strong user base. And so we are working with him in a way to make that work. And so again, where you continue the great engagement and then you frankly add to the site as opposed to detract them a site. That’s the nuance you really want on a lot of your things is where ads really help create the user experience as opposed to detract from the user experience. 
 Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse 
 Got it. So you have done a number of acquisitions, buttressed your mobile business and you have also significantly made some investments into mobile as well. So I mean, when do you think these investments will turn into significant financial returns for the company? 
 Ken Goldman 
 Well, I certainly hope soon. No, I mean, we are – our heads if you will, if you sort of say you think about how you run a company, you think about the things you have to work on that. We were extremely internally focused on ‘13 to get our act together, if you will, both in terms of some of the things I already talked about in terms of getting the business rhythm. And the traction of people, the management of employees, getting the products figuring out what products had to be, getting the organization in place, figuring out what products had to be updated, when they had to be updated, getting all of that process didn’t quite exist. Again, I think by and large that work, I don’t say it’s done, because we obviously keep on doing that, but at least the jumpstart there is behind us. And so now again, I can’t overemphasize that we are now very, very focused on the top line growing the revenue, growing GAAP, I mean, we have been focused on ex-TAC revenue probably because when we transition to Microsoft search, there is no TAC involved, where they used to be TAC involved when we had Yahoo! search. And so certainly the TAC was going down. So to look at ex-TAC was more representative of where the business was going GAAP revenue. We will be now looking more to GAAP revenue because that’s now more synonymous with the real business as well as ex-TAC. So we are going to be looking at the true top line the GAAP revenue, we are very focused on that. How we do it, what kind of deals we do affiliates outside the network, inside the network through trading fits and so forth. Our global ad network, we are going to look at all of that and so some of them may have revenue share whatever again we want to I have said before increase the throw weight of the total Yahoo! So we are going to be very, very focused on that top line business. And then over time how does that translate into greater operating profit, EBITDA and cash flow. 
 Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse 
 Yes, I mean what are positive impacts that Marissa exerted on the company was its ability to go out and hire against some very strong competition. So what is your outlook in terms of heading into 2014 in terms of your ability to continue to hire and get the talent that you need to continue to drive the business? 
 Ken Goldman 
 Yes I mean, we have said we have thousands and thousands of unsolicited resumes, but it’s interesting in the old days if a company had a equal offers from Yahoo! and X, Y, Z they would go with that would go – almost always X, Y, Z. Today if we have equal offers more likely than not they will come to us. And so we find people who want to come. They have recognized we still have lot of work to do, but they want to get on. They like the challenge, like the kind of products we are doing, they like the team we have in place starting with Marissa on down. They like the fact that it’s frankly been no controversy with the company. That was the case couple of years ago. So we are having really I don’t want to say no challenge in hiring because competition for talent is pretty extreme in internet space. By having saying that we are doing quite well in attracting folks that want to come here. We have done very well as we acquired companies keeping those folks which is obviously a key sign. We have done very well attracting new people to the company, our attrition is down. So these kind of things have improved markedly over the last year. We do engagement surveys, I don’t want to go to exact numbers, but the engagement surveys, employee satisfaction was up dramatically year-over-year as well. So the things that we see as a team in terms of the likability of working at Yahoo! much, much higher today than it certainly was a year ago when many of us came. 
 Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse 
 Understood, so I mean I think you mentioned games as a product area earlier. You are seeing a lot of the other large internet operators with lots of traffic turn to that vertical as a lead generator to and monetize that way I mean Yahoo! traditionally have had a gaming site but there hasn’t been much in the way of activity. So is there going to be a focus at least in the near to mid-term in terms of becoming a lead sports source for that vertical? 
 Ken Goldman 
 I don’t want to get too far there, but we did acquire a small company in games as well. We think of generic games whether it is Bingo, Scrabble and things like that, so we are not going to compete with some of the gaming companies you might think of, so that’s not our space. Our space is more of what are the sort of the daily kinds of games that people would use. You might be on a plane, you want to play a game with yourself Poker, Scrabble whatever. Those are kinds of games we want to have in our site that we work on that people use day in, day out as opposed to some of the digital games you have all heard of. So that’s the space, so the generic games are games that last year and year and year as opposed to the one-hit wonders that’s not the space that we are in. I mean I am not saying we might not do something with someone down the road in which we partner with someone whatever, but we are going to be inventing, I don’t see that certainly today. And we are not going to be inventing those kind of games. We are much more in the generic kind of games that people have used for years and years and years. 
 Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse 
 Understood so I think probably one of the last things – one of the last issues that I want to kind of focus on was I mean how are you thinking about your investments in Asia. I know we had a presentation earlier today and especially also with Yahoo! Japan. 
 Ken Goldman 
 I think of it in several ways. One is sort of flippant comment. I mean we have two very strongly appreciating assets which has been helpful for the company in terms of the company stock price clearly. Yahoo! Japan is up 78% year-over-year in terms of its price, Alibaba whatever valuation you want uses up several times fold from where it was a year ago. So those have been appreciating assets. And I would like participating and appreciating assets. In the case of Yahoo! Japan is things we think we can do strategically with them. We are doing more than ever with strategically in terms of our respective businesses. So we think there is more to do there. I like being involved with them. They certainly have our name. So we think there is more we can do with them. This stock doesn’t trade very much. So we like the fact that we own 35%. And we get nice between royalties and their equity earnings and so forth, it’s been very attractive for us. 
 In the case of Alibaba, again, that’s been beyond anyone’s expectations. You heard Joe and many of you probably heard Joe today, they have just done phenomenal. They have exceeded any – expectation anyone has had for them. Our relationship with them, maybe if you take one thing out of this meeting, our relationship with them has never been better, very, very cordial. We work with them very well. It’s dramatically different than it was couple of years ago. So again, that’s a great relationship. We are glad to be partners and investors and shareholders with them. I give Jerry Yang a lot of credit. He invested in both Yahoo! Japan and Alibaba and those multi, multi, multi-fold, they would rank up with any good venture investment that anyone would have made ever in the world of equity investing, the venture investing. So hands off or not hands off, hats off to the team there for that. And so right now, that’s what we are working on. I hope we can find over time great ways to utilize the Alibaba proceeds at such time as they go public. I hope you don’t have to pay a lot of taxes. We are still working on that. So we are very active on that. We did announce as I talked about $5 billion buyback. So we do think our stock continues to be, is a good investment and well, that will be one of the ways that we do provide cash back to our investors. 
 Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse 
 With that, we are out of time. Thanks very much. 
 Ken Goldman 
 Thank you.

   Elekta B SHS (GM:EKTAF) F2Q14 Earnings Call December  4, 2013  4:00 AM ET 
 
 Operator 
 Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Elekta Q2 report conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct a question and answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) I'd now like to hand over to the Chairperson, Mr. Johan Andersson. Please go ahead, sir. And I will be standing by. 
 Johan Andersson 
 Thank you very much, and welcome to Elekta’s conference call following the publication of our Q2 report for the fiscal year 2013-2014. My name is Johan Andersson, and I will be the moderator for this call. Here in Stockholm, we have Tomas Puusepp, President and CEO; Håkan Bergström, CFO; the Treasury team, corporate controlling and investor relations. 
 We will start with a presentation by Tomas Puusepp and Håkan Bergström and afterwards conclude with a Q&amp;A session. In the Q&amp;A session we will ask you to limit yourself to two questions per participant. 
 With this, I will hand it over to Tomas Puusepp. 
 Tomas Puusepp 
 Thank you, Johan and once again welcome to Elekta quarter two conference call. It is gratifying to see that our long-term growth strategy is continuing to be successful. Business in the second quarter was strong and order bookings increased with 10%. The development in Europe, Middle East and Africa was particularly good and order bookings rose 32% in local currency. 
 Growth was strong in all territories. Our progress is very good in North America and order bookings rose 21% in the second quarter. This is significantly stronger than the market as a whole. In Asia Pacific we remain confident of the performance for the full year. For the first half, order intake has been roughly flat but this should be viewed in light of the sharp increase noted in the preceding year. 
 During the first half, net sales increased 10% with good growth in all regions. EBITDA, excluding items affecting comparability, amounted to SEK 555 million for the first six months. Compared with last year, the proportion of proportion of Leksell Gamma Knife units in the product mix was lower, but that’s on a stronger order intake. Deliveries are expected to be stronger during the second half of the year. 
 Exchange-rate effects had a negative impact of SEK 90 million. Adjusted for the exchange rate effect, EBITDA is up 8%. Also note that the second quarter last year was very strong for us, actually stronger than Q3 last year. So the comparison for Q2 was very tough. 
 Cash flow is expected to be significantly stronger for the second half which is in line with the seasonal patterns of prior years. We continue to fuel our growth strategy by price rising, investment in product development as well as in training and education. During the period investment increased by SEK 200 million which is mainly attributable to research and development and training and education centers. As the number of cancer patients continues to increase throughout the world, we see a growing demand for the use of radiation therapy as a modality for cancer care. 
 We reiterate our outlook for the full year. Net sales is expected to grow by more than 10% and EBITDA is expected to grow by approximately 10% in local currencies. 
 We are the technology leader in radiation therapy. Sales of our latest and most advanced linear accelerator, Versa HD is developing strongly, actually better than expected in our main markets which is Europe and North America. We have recently launched Esteya, our new solution for the treatment of skin cancer, which is actually one of the fastest growing cancer in the world. Skin care is a new and incremental segment for Elekta. Our customers have shown very strong interest in it and we are working at full pace to be able to deliver accordingly. 
 Elekta’s important development project, MR Linac, is progressing very well. Our research consortium recently met with MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston as the host. The group represented a large proportion of the collective global expertise in modern cancer care. During the meeting, the members shared experiences and planned the next steps in development work. 
 We have also launched our new treatment planning solution Monaco 5. The interest from our customers is exceeding our expectations. In this solution, we have combined all key features from our existing treatment planning system into one platform. Monaco is a very competitive solution and with this platform we will be able to strengthen our market share with treatment planning software. As expected, Monaco received 510(k) clearance from the FDA during last week. And that's making it available for purchases and use in the United States. 
 Let me go through the development in our regions starting then with North and South America. The Elekta business in North America is strong and is growing faster than the total market. Our order bookings were up 21% in the quarter and our prospects for the full year continue to be strong. We had good progress with sales volume of our new Versa HD and feedback from our customers is very positive and exceeding our expectations. Reimbursement levels for the next year were decided by CMS in November and this means increased reimbursement for all areas applicable to Elekta. 
 For treatment with Leksell Gamma Knife, the reimbursement for next year is up and importantly, the suggestion of bundling was added on in the final decision. This means that customers still can get reimbursed for additional codes for the total procedure. 
 Turning to Canada. We experienced a continuing expansion and build-out of our capacity in cancer care and have very strong position in the country. As you all know, we decided to step up of the major procurement process in Brazil. The process affected the whole market during the period and order bookings and of course, also order bookings in South America due to that declined for us in the period. However with this effect and Elekta’s long term growth potential and commitment to the continent remains unchanged. And also pricing is back at normal levels. 
 Turning to regions, Europe, Middle East and Africa. We’ve had an excellent performance in the region and order intake grew 32% in quarter two and it’s up 26% from the first half. The established markets demonstrated favorable growth across all territories and we achieved particularly strong growth in Scandinavia and France. In Europe as well, Versa HD made good progress, which is fully in line with the ongoing plans towards demand for more effective and advanced treatment systems. We can also report that the first patient was treated with Esteya in Spain. The development in emerging markets have also been very strong in the region. 
 Then turning to Asia Pacific. The Asia Pacific region is characterized by a major capacity shortage and the prospects for growth remain good for many years to come. We are the market leader in the region and we see strong order growth prospect for the full year. 
 Elekta’s business in Japan continue to grow and our collaboration with Toshiba is performing very well and we expect to continue to increase our market share in oncology. Our cancer care solutions are much appreciated by customers currently using Siemens machines. 
 China developed in line with expectations and comparisons should take into consideration the record order we booked in Q2 last year. Prospects are good for strong development in China for the remainder of the year. In line with our growth strategy, we recently opened a Beijing LINC, Learning and Innovation Center, which is a state-of-the-art training and education center in China. 
 In India, import regulations for radiation therapy equipment were recently amended, and this combined with a weak currency, had resulted in delays of orders and deliveries. As I said, we see good prospect for order growth for the full year in Asia Pacific region. 
 Now, I hand things over to Håkan for a more detailed view of the numbers. 
 Håkan Bergström 
 Thank you, Tomas. Looking into the performance for the first half, I can say that it came in very well in line with our own expectation. And we do remain confident on the outlook for the full fiscal year. We base our forecast on a detailed bottom-up process, whether regions and the business units have good visibility based on backlog of course and detailed discussions with customer on planned deliveries. 
 Order bookings as already said increased 10% in Q2 and is up 5% for the first half year organically. Sales was up 3% in the quarter and 10% in the half year based on fixed currencies. As said, deliveries were very much in line with our plan. What is less in Q2 compared to last year was actually Gamma Knife and I get back to that in a moment. The order backlog is increasing and looking at the last 12 months it’s up 12% in fixed currency and in this year it has grown SEK 600 million up to SEK 12.5 billion. 
 Looking at EBITDA, as Tomas just said, it’s an increase with 8% excluding negative currency effect and non-recurring items. The negative year-over-year currency effect is 6% for the top line and impacted the result with SEK 90 million. Based on the current currency environment we do expect for the full year a negative currency effect of about 3% on net sales and about 5% on EBITDA. 
 Gross margin for the half year was slightly lower than 43% which compared to last year was negatively affected mainly by currencies but also by lower volumes of Leksell Gamma Knife in the first half year and somewhat also the medical device tax in U.S. For the second half of year, a high number of Gamma Knife will be shipped, which is based on the strongest ever first half order intake. So it’s very much a timing effect for the Gamma Knife that we saw and the business continued to be solid. 
 Non-recurring items related to legal costs came in at $61 million and the lawsuit with Varian is now concluded and ended. As said, we are in an investment period and the acceleration in product development is mainly driven by the MR Linac project. We do forecast gross R&amp;D investment to be higher than 10% on net sales for the full year. 
 For tax, we have a tax rate for this year to be at 24%. There are quite substantial lowering of corporate tax rates and other initiatives that going forward we will benefit of and we will see us going towards 22% within, say, two years. 
 Now looking into cash flow and drivers there. As we already have communicated, cash flow will strengthen quarter by quarter for this fiscal year. So it’s obvious that cash flow now is expected to be significantly stronger for the remainder of the year mainly driven from the operating profit that is forecasted. The fiscal year forecast gives the cash conversion of around 60%. 
 Looking into investments, we have SEK 200 million for the first half and for the second half we see slightly lower level compared to the first half. When it comes to working capital, we foresee that net working capital will remain at the same level as last year which is about 11%. 
 In line with our seasonality, we have built inventory in Q2 which then will be delivered during the next quarters. So looking at the working capital items from the beginning of the year, our receivables – accounts receivables has increased with around SEK 50 million. Accrued income has decreased with SEK 300 million and inventory is up SEK 250 million. So all in all it’s on the same level. 
 Finally then a short summary of the question that we have received during the last month and how then we answer those. And one of the areas is when do elect the booking order and we do book orders when we have a signed agreement without any contingencies or if we have received a public tender or governmental tender award. Payment or payment terms is secured, we have a delivery date and we have a customer site. So with that order booking principle, we are quite confident that our backlog remains in very good shape. 
 In the backlog hardware service and software consist of slightly different maturities. Hardware obviously then Gamma Knife, Linac and some other pieces are sometimes bundled with software and mostly these are planned deliveries within 12 months of the date of order. It could be actual three months as well, all depends obviously if the site is already prepared or not. For software and some part – for service and some part of the software the majority will be delivered within 18 months. It’s no changes on any time that has been noted from past year. 
 When it comes to hardware, the majority of the planned deliveries for this year actually goes to emerging markets, while most of the software goes to mature markets. And also reminder when it comes to revenue recognition, that main principle is risk and reward, that risk and reward has passed to the call customer. This is frequently checked by our audit team and we have had that discussion yesterday and they have checked the number of projects and they have concluded that our revenue recognition has passed without comments, so basically fine. 
 We of course have a slight differences when it comes to when invoicing takes place but as you have heard that the crude income means that we are now invoicing more than we did before. So that ratio has improved. For more details when it comes to the revenue recognition and accounting principles, please read our annual report or contact myself or the IR department. 
 With that Tomas, I leave it back to you. 
 Tomas Puusepp 
 Okay, thank you, Håkan. As I said earlier, the business outlook for the year is good. We expect that this year will be another good year for us and in line with our long term growth agenda. We have a strong product pipeline with many interesting projects within all our product areas. The important project MR Linac is showing great progress. We reiterate the outlook for the year. Net sales is expected to grow by 10% in local currency. EBITDA is expected to grow by approximately 10% at local currencies, and the currency effect is estimated to be some minus 5% on the growth. 
 So to conclude, we reiterate the business outlook and we foresee good growth in all markets for the year. We anticipate a significantly stronger cash flow for the remainder of the year but remember we are also stepping up our investment in product development. We expect a good fiscal year with strong growth in sales and result and also good development in our R&amp;D portfolio that supports the long term sustainable profitable growth. Thank you. 
 Johan Andersson 
 So thank you very much Tomas ad Håkan, and we will now start the Q&amp;A session. So please operator?

SGMS," 
   Scientific Games Corporation (SGMS) Bank of America Merrill Lynch Leveraged Finance Conference December  4, 2013  2:50 PM ET 
 
 Unidentified Analyst 
 Good afternoon everyone again, very happy to be able to introduce Scientific Games. We have Robert Becker who is the Vice President and Treasurer at Scientific Games. Scientific Games obviously disclosed a large transformational acquisition that we helped to finance. Very happy to have you here and he'll go through the story. Thanks Robert. 
 Robert Becker 
 Thank you everybody for coming. Sort of feel a little bit like a school teacher, reminds me of the like the last day before summer break. You guys here had a big meal and 81 degrees and sunny outside and you showed up for the presentation so I appreciate that. 
 Just like to go through briefly a presentation about the Company, businesses we're involved in and then open it up to any questions. I would like to draw your attention to our statement about non-disclosure information and non-GAAP measures, it's in the presentation, it's also on our website. 
 For those of you who have followed Scientific Games for a few years, I'll be describing the Company that's significantly different than we were in the past, as a result of an acquisition of WMS Industries that we completed about seven weeks ago. And it was a highly complementary and transformative transaction. 
 On a combined basis, we are a leading developer of technology-based products and services for the gaming and lottery industries. We provide a full suite of products and services, whether they're for the lottery, instant-ticketing systems, whether for casinos, land-based casinos or on the Internet. And we also have a full suite of integrated products and services that we provide through the Internet. 
 We are a performance-focused organization. We're headquartered in New York with substantial operating presence in few countries. Headquartered in Chicago as our gaming business, Atlanta is sort of a headquarters for our lottery business, but we also have presence in Beijing, Las Vegas, Leeds, London, Montreal, Pune, India, which is an important part of our synergy objectives, Santiago, Chile and Vienna, we have about 5,000 employees globally. 
 Combined revenues on the LTM 6/30 basis of about $1.6 billion, generating attributable EBITDA of about 663 million which we include about 100 million of anticipated run rate synergies. And we have a current equity market cap of about 1.5 billion enterprise value of 4.5 million. 
 We believe that we are at a favorable alignment point, where we have the core competencies of innovative technology and creative and comprehensive content in a Company that we now have size and scope to pursue what we see as a convergence in the gaming industry sort of between lotteries and the gaming business. 
 In just about the, the financial categories if you'd look at we are a leading provider in this space. Near the comp in revenues and in EBITDA and on EBITDA margin basis, on a LTM basis 6/30. We are showing the sort of leadership position there. 
 I'm going to describe the Company in three main categories, lottery, gaming and interactive. And just give you a brief overview of each of those. The lottery business accounts for about 50% of our revenues. In this business we are the leading provider of instant-tickets for lotteries around the world. This is about $75 billion worldwide market. We have a very comprehensive manufacturing capabilities. We have nine presses in five countries that generate roughly and can print roughly 45 billion tickets. All those tickets are developed and designed with a very comprehensive portfolio of brands, both brands that we have created and licensed brands from third-parties. And we have shipped tickets to 50 countries around the world and also supplied to 40 states here in the U.S. 
 On the lottery systems business, this is the business that is the network lotteries where if you go buy a lottery ticket or a Powerball or Mega Millions, we also are a leading provider in this space. This is a 200 billion market worldwide. We have 10 full service management contracts in the U.S. and we’ve supplied over the years dozens of similar contracts and networks around the globe. We are a leading provider of game design sort of the full suite of services going from game design to marketing to integrated delivery and telemarketing services and this is what we bring to our lottery customers. 
 And we have a strong portfolio of contracts, contracts in the Printed Products Group generally known from three to five years with renewals in the systems business they generally run a little bit longer because of the capital requirement. But we have a portfolio of these tickets, of these contracts that are running out for a number of years and we expect that we’ll maybe see about 10% coming to free over the next 12 months. 
 A little bit more about the printed products business. This business is in mature markets so we continue to see growth. Our revenues grew about 4% year-over-year, and a quarter ending September. Some of the new contracts that we have coming onboard we are a supplier to the new privatized New Jersey Lottery through our equity ownership there and participation with Gtech. We are the exclusive provider to the Greek State Lotteries and these are both multiyear contracts 12 years in the case of Greek’s and 15 I believe in the case of New Jersey. We’re a exclusive supplier to tickets to the Greek Lotteries. In the third quarter we started the Dominican Republic into ticket lottery and in Panama that was started in October. 
 As I mentioned this is a mature market but we believe that there are ample opportunities for growth. We have a very robust loyalty program. We feel that there is an opportunity to extend that to new jurisdictions and new customers. We believe that in the international market in U.S. roughly 60% to 70% of the market is instant tickets and outside the U.S. that’s more like 20%, so we believe that there is a vast opportunity for growth of instant tickets outside the U.S. and we believe we can also generate additional EBITDA synergies by increasing our production efficiencies. 
 Lottery systems business, we saw 11.5% increase year-over-year growth in the third quarter this was largely driven by some of the jackpot games, but again this is the business where we -- in the U.S. we are generally providing things on a participation basis outside the U.S. it’s generally a sales business with an ongoing service contract so some of that revenue growth came from equipment sales. Some of those sales that we’ll realize in the coming quarters are sales to Delaware State Lottery Switzerland and also a very major customer in Norway. 
 The growth drivers here we have a system that’s in place our capital is in place and we feel that there is a great opportunity to develop incremental business by increasing your price points and it’s only take us at a higher price also developing new types of games all of that revenue would generate substantial margin because your CapEx is and your operating margins are fixed at that point. We also believe there is opportunities to develop the iLottery opportunities Delaware’s one state, North Carolina is another that is pursuing some lottery opportunities by selling it through the Internet. 
 Gaming business is our second category and it consists of the legacy Scientific Games gaming business and the WMS business. What’s important to note is that while we were both in this phase WMS being far larger than the Scientific Games’ gaming business it’s very complementary, because we were approaching different markets both in terms of geographies and in terms of the types of lotteries that we or the types of gaming machines we were selling. 
 We believe we’re a leading innovator and developer of creating content and gaming machines. We have now a very robust pipeline of cabinet and game production that’s coming out for sale. We are leading provider in the for-sale market, but we also have a very large participation business in North America and UK. And what’s important is that all of this business is supported by a very comprehensive content program both developed and licensed. 
 Scientific Games gaming business and this is our legacy business which is centered in UK. We have about like close to 25,000 terminals in the UK. These are all networked through their LBO offices. So from a technology standpoint, we have a very robust program have a lot of terminals connected in wide area, and that’s important when we look forward to how we can provide some revenue synergies with WMS. 
 We also had an installed base of about 5,000 terminals in a few markets in the Caribbean and in Latin America. This business has been affected by a couple of things, economic conditions, weather conditions in UK had impacted this business such as we saw decline in revenue year-over-year for about 7% or 8%. 
 We also exited a ancillary business that wasn’t really core, that was selling arcades and similar types of machines to the pub business that also had an impact on our revenue. And our customer relationships are strong and that was evidenced by a recent renewal, a final renewal of contract with our largest customer in the UK Ladbrokes where we’re delivering 9,000 terminals for that 5 year renewal. 
 We believe that the opportunities for growth here are pretty immediate by taking in our existing networks and courting some of WMS’s very strong content onto our networks thereby increasing the appeal to the players and therefore the participation in those games, and we feel then that we can also expand that footprint. 
 WMS gaming, as I mentioned they’re a little bit different than we were -- they are strong in both the for-sale casino business and also they have a participation business as well. The revenue was up 3.5% in the June quarter that was largely the result of new product that they put out, the Gamefield xD cabinet is a participation-based cabinet. This is a high player appeal of cabinet that offered it to casinos for participation, it came out and we now have four games available for that cabinet. 
 The Blade cabinet also came out in March of 2013 and we’re seeing a very high relative performance of this cabinet versus the other competitors. What’s important about that is that the performance when it’s relatively higher than your competitors. You both can increase you ship share in future orders. You also can support your premium pricing which is what we have been able to do. It’s important to keep this product fresh and we came out with this cabinet with six games. We now can offer up to 24 games to our customers. 
 Growth drivers for WMS Gaming, we were very excited about this. WMS in the recent past had not delivered a regular group of new products. They had about an 18-month hiatus where they hadn’t come out with any new products and they sold ship share, suffered because of that and we are all focused on that now and both the cabinets, and the game content is going to be coming and we have a strong pipeline to have this product come out on a more regular basis. We expect to have a launching in the spring of 2014 for instance of a new mechanical real game that has a participation aspect to it through a Monopoly game. 
 We see that the Scientific Games historical international presence is going to be something that WMS business can leverage, so we can now take the U.S. product to customers at overseas, similarly our systems capability as I mentioned, we have this network capability for our gaming business and we feel that we can use their strong slot content and pair that with our system capabilities and grow the business that way. 
 The third category, relatively small at this point but growing and very important is the interactive business. Here's where we're seeing the convergence of gaming between sort of traditional gaming and lotteries, we feel that one of the places we’re going to see this is the Internet. WMS has, brings to us the Jackpot Party Social Casino, which is a Play4Fun site, and it's one of the top sites, it's available on all platforms and it's available through Facebook and social web connections as well. 
 Play4Fun network is a B2B sort of a white label product that we provide and this is the same sort of games that players see and play for real in the casino, in the land-based casino they cannot play on the Internet and again it's that brand recognition aspect and we are providing that to our casino customers with the knowledge that hopefully someday the regulations will change and they'll be able to turn these sites from the Play4Fun to a real money game. 
 Outside of the U.S. where Internet waging is already legal, we have the remote game server where all of our products that we are providing on land-based casino operators, we can now port those to the online casino operators as well. And again just around the apple what we can do here we have a B2B sports betting software, all of these things are supported by our loyalty and reward programs, which get your players sort of an infinity program and get your players connected to your games. 
 Growth drivers here, sort of the secular trends for everything being on the Internet and wireless, people want to play games, the games that they want, when they want, where they want and we feel we're positioned to do that, we feel that the social gaming part of WMS business still has room for a lot of growth both in the U.S. and internationally and ultimately more real money gaming either from lotteries, such as Delaware which just launched this fall, a iGaming, iLottery site, and when that expands to other states, we feel we’re positioned for that. 
 We have grown in the past through some of our equity investments and these investments have been necessary for a number of reasons, but the important ones are in Italy and Greece, for example, it’s important to partner with a local company it's a way to get into the market, and that's why we’ve entered into that strategic relationship. 
 In China, it was more of a regulatory issue without foreign ownership, in Northstar both in Illinois and New Jersey it was important to pair with a partner who had complementary technology and also somebody who could defray the investment, minimize what our investment requirements were. The important part of what we do with our strategic investment is that we secure a supply contract. So if you will the equity ownership is the price of entry but what we really want to do is to get the supply contract either for the instant-tickets or for the lottery system. 
 We haven’t really talked publically about our, the revenue synergies that we feel are achievable from the acquisition but they're no less real than the cost synergies that we've talked about a little more specifically. The first thing I want to point out is that we have a systems capability in Scientific Games that is very robust and is capable of handling wide area networks, that wasn't something that WMS was very strong in, so we feel that we can generate significant growth by pairing our technology with their content. 
 As I mentioned before Scientific Games has a presence, significant presence outside the U.S. that now lends us the ability to take the WMS products and services and gives us an antre into these other markets, just to grow that business. 
 WMS has great content and this is where we feel that we can Scientific Games can benefit by porting some of their content to our existing platforms both on the Internet and on land-based wide area networks. And our interactive businesses are pretty complementary as well. License product is sort of very important part of our businesses. We have both at very high profile and very productive license brands and that is how we're developing our content to attract players to games both instant-ticket games and lottery games and as well as slot games. 
 And one good example now as we believe we can take this brand name Jackpot Party that's well recognized in social gaming and creators to pick it forth as an example. And the other -- I guess the last point here is that we have been B2G supplier Scientific Games because lotteries, our buyers our customers. WMS has been B2B Company and we feel that we have some revenues and opportunities by selling to each other's customers. 
 In terms of the cost synergies real quickly we have talked about the $100 million the number we came up with after doing some extensive analysis early on in the acquisition process. We had a nine month period where we had to get regulatory approval and we had an opportunity to have a very detailed and in-depth integration plans on a department-by-department basis. And we in fact validated the 100 million of expected synergies we feel very strongly about that. 
 From a total cost standpoint we feel it's achievable because it really represents less than 10% of the combined expenditures of the Company, but we feel it's very achievable. As I said we have detailed plans, the former CFO of WMS is now the CFO of our gaming business is also the Chief Integration Officer. So we didn't just sort of go through some planning and then decide to let it just happen on its own. 
 We have a very rigorous program for making sure that these synergies get achieved and we have some person in charge of making sure that all the initiatives that were identified are actually completed. We expect to hit our 100 million run rate by the end of 2015, but we expect all of the initiatives that will lead to that 100 million to be in place by the end of 2014. 
 The important thing also to note is that we recognized that WMS's strength is in their content and in their creativity and their innovation. And the synergies that we have identified are administrative in nature, overlapping finance, legal accounting and those types of things. We also feel that there are some savings by transitioning some of Scientific Games’ high cost engineering to low cost jurisdictions. 
 WMS has established an engineering facility in Pune, India and we feel that there is substantial savings that we can accrue by moving engineering there. But we're very clearly and everybody is very keenly aware that we do not want to kill the goose that lay the golden egg and in terms of synergies they will not touch the content and development products. 
 This is just a representation here of our cash flow, one of the things that we're happy about is that the businesses we expect to generate anywhere between 150 million to 200 million of free cash flow this is after normalized capital expenditures, our pro forma interest and some assumptions for working capital. 
 Our capital structure, capital structure we closed on our $2.6 billion accredit facility funded with a 2.3 billion term loan, we now have below under a 3.1 billion of net debt. Our leverage considering attributable are to the attributable EBITDA and anticipated synergies is about 4.6 which is slightly above where we were pre-acquisition, we feel this is a very a sort of comfortable level because of the company’s free cash flow generation because we have long-term recurring revenue contracts and because of our significant liquidity that currently exists in the form of cash and undrawn revolver. 
 And the other thing I like about this capital position is that we do have the opportunity to prepay the debt without penalty. In terms of our capital structure, we have about four and a half a year period where we don’t have any near-term maturities of any size. So this gives us a long runway to accomplish our synergies, our growth plans and I have to worry about refinancings or debt paydowns. 
 So, in closing the key credit highlights, we are a leading innovative supplier of gaming and technology in the Indian technologies space we’ve got a diverse and recurring revenue base, we’ve got marquee customers both commercial customers and government customers an extensive portfolio of high visibility brands, substantial free cash flow generation and favorable industry dynamics we see the conversions in gaming that we can benefit from and we see that the industry maybe in the consolidation phase and we think that we are in a good position to benefit from that. So that’s the remarks I have that, any questions. Yes sir.

SSTK," 
   Shutterstock, Inc. (SSTK) Credit Suisse Technology Conference December  4, 2013  5:00 PM ET 
 
 Dean Prissman 
 Good afternoon I'm Dean Prissman one of the Internet Analysts at CS, and we are excited to welcome Tim Bixby, CFO, Shutterstock, welcome Tim. 
 Tim Bixby 
 Afternoon. 
 Dean Prissman 
 So just for those in the audience not as familiar with your story, can you just give us some background on how the company was founded and just some color on Shutterstock's business model and the network impacts on your business? 
 Tim Bixby 
 Sure, happy to. So, I'm Tim Bixby, CFO at Shutterstock, we’ve built a nice business, launched it, found it, after signing about 10 years ago, 2003, Shutterstock's a very disruptive player in the licensed images market, so we built a marketplace basically a two sided marketplace where contributors bring images and video footage to Shutterstock, that we then license to businesses around the world. We've got about 750,000 user accounts around the world, 70% of our revenue is from outside the United States and growing pretty rapidly over the past several years growing at about a 40% rate, pretty profitable at the moment, so with a nice network effect with more content feeding our library and then a larger more diverse library encouraging more customers to come and test out the service. 
 Dean Prissman 
 Great, thank you and how would you say you’ve disrupted the traditional stock photo market? 
 Tim Bixby 
 Well, one of the things we did, and this was really true from the original founding of the Company is we approached pricing differently. So not only did we price our licenses at a low level, so a disruptively low price but we also approached it in a very transparent and simple and clear structure, so at Shutterstock in 2003 and through to today, you're able to license images, very high quality images on a subscription. 
 So a monthly recurring subscription, a fixed rate where a customer of ours can download up to 25 images per day, everyday forever basically, and that is kind of perceived or felt from a user standpoint as essentially unlimited, and so it creates a sort of a utility feeling where Shutterstock is a service, it’s always there always on, the prices are low but more importantly predictable and transparent and that's not something that was common in the industry before Shutterstock came along. 
 Dean Prissman 
 And can you benchmark the technology you have relative to your competitor set? 
 Tim Bixby 
 Yes, I think our customers are looking for a couple of things, so when they come to us, they want the content, first and foremost they want amazing images, we’ve got about 30 million images today we've got more than a million video clips, all freely available to license to our customers. But also they're looking for a capability to get out the right image quickly and efficiently, so the search technology which you're getting at I think is a critical competitive differentiator for us, because Shutterstock is the volume leader. We, even though we're not the revenue leader in this market yet, we're the volume leader, we're downloading about three images per second, 24 hours a day to our customers, therefore we have more data, more search information, more metadata that we're collecting in real time everyday and therefore our technology our search algorithms, our search capabilities are able to improve consistently and much more rapidly than other players, and that's the second piece and the third piece is really the price structure that we talked about. 
 Dean Prissman 
 Got it, so even though about 70% of your revenue as you said is international, global expansion is obviously a key part of your strategy, can you provide some color on the opportunity and the specific tactics you have in place? 
 Tim Bixby 
 Sure, so, internationally, the Company was founded and headquartered in the United States, in New York City, but since day one we had a significant amount of revenue outside the U.S., about 70%, and part of the driver of that obviously is just the nature of imagery, many images are global in nature there's not language or words in them they could be used in many different settings. But we also did a couple of things quickly to amplify this effect, one of which was translating the site quickly into multiple languages, the site is now in 20 different languages, we accept 10 different currencies on the site and we’ve also been really beefing up our local content, so while our content if you're living in the United States or in the UK or in Australia, it is quite strong and will work for your needs and looks like images that you may be trying to portray for your business. 
 If you're in Malaysia or India or Japan that's less so the case and a key part of our strategy now is to build out that local content so that's it's strong in every territory in the world, all 200 countries, as it is in our top and most mature markets, as it is in the U.S., the UK and Australia. 
 Dean Prissman 
 And just sticking with the topic, can you put some relativity around your progress in certain international geographies? 
 Tim Bixby 
 Yes, so our most penetrated markets, one metric we use which I think is helpful is, if we were to increase our penetration in our developing markets, to the level that we've attained in our most mature markets, our business will essentially double. So while we're in every country there's still a long way to go. We’re able to generate revenue on our site, in every country to people who have Internet access, website access, but we're not able to provide direct enterprise sales support in every country yet, so we’ve been expanding that significantly over the past couple of years. We’ve got our direct sales force and enterprise sales team in the U.S., also now in Western Europe, Berlin, London, the UK, and we’ll also be expanding into Japan, Singapore and other parts of Asia Pacific over the next couple of years. 
 Dean Prissman 
 Got it, and just sticking with international, so I believe your most recent quarterly tax rate was about 38% which seems pretty high for a business with your international mix, is there a process to bring this down and any timing you can share? 
 Tim Bixby 
 Yes, I think this is definitely one of the opportunities when you're a young and rapidly growing Company, this one doesn’t rise to the top until the right time, now is the right time. I think the nature of licensing images, it's a little tougher than shipping physical goods in terms of how you optimize tax rates, but it is something we’re focused on, and I think we’ve seen companies attain tax rates of 30% or better just by kind of following best practices and leveraging their revenue streams around the world and we're on-track to do that, probably over the next two to three years. 
 Dean Prissman 
 So just shifting gears to video, can you discuss how video and emerging content types increase your TAM? 
 Tim Bixby 
 Sure, so we look at the addressable market as in the four going to $6 billion range, if you look at, sort of now over the next three to four years. Within that video footage is a significant component. It’s a smaller piece, the majority is images, but video footage is interesting. It’s made this transition from something that was seldom used by a sophisticated production houses. So people making movies, TV shows, documentaries, would invariably want to shoot the imagery, the footage themselves. 
 That has not changed towards very common in almost every film’s production that there is some element of stock imagery, stock footage that’s being used. And the reason for that is the quality is dramatically higher than it was five or six or seven years ago. So that’s one trend that’s happening. And I think the other trend that we’re seeing start today, or beginning today, that I think is going to take a few years to play out is the use of video imagery, moving imagery or footage by businesses in marketing in advertising. So that’s an area where I think it’s just getting going, every company has got their YouTube channel. They’re not sure what to do with it. They are looking at Vimeo, they are figuring out user generating content. It’s not clear how that’s shaking out but we’re confident at Shutterstock that over the next five, six, seven years that a significant proportion of outbound marketing from companies, from enterprises will include some sort of video component and we know that we just want to be there as that evolves. 
 Dean Prissman 
 And then how do you think about the unit economics of your video product offering? 
 Tim Bixby 
 Sure, so a couple of metrics I think are helpful. In terms of effective price for Shutterstock, our customers are paying anywhere from a little over a dollar to several hundred dollars for each image license that each image that they license from Shutterstock. And it depends on their volume and the size of the company and the rights that they want along with that image. But that’s the rough scope. If you take all of the revenue of the company; all of the downloads, our overall effective price is about $2.35, right around there. 
 Video footage is a dramatic step-up. So it’s about $60 effective price. A high-definition video footage on our site is about $79 per image, per video clip download. So it’s a significantly higher price point. We are paying out royalties to the contributors in line with that higher price point and so the margins are fairly consistent, whether you are licensing images at the low-end, at the high-end, or you are licensing video from Shutterstock, our cost structure and margin structure is similar across the whole business. 
 Dean Prissman 
 So you recently entered a partnership with Facebook, can you discuss some of the details here? 
 Tim Bixby 
 Sure, so Facebook is an interesting one. It’s a great name, it’s a good household example, so if you will understand that how we are attacking our API strategy. So we are selling directly off of our website. Licenses, we’re selling through an enterprise sales team. We’re also developing, indirect sales where third-parties, companies that have technology expertise can take our API, our code base and integrate it within their own customer offering. So the Facebook example is a good one where it’s now live and being used by customers, a proportion of Facebook’s customers where an advertiser at Facebook has to find an image. Most advertising in Facebook has some sort of imagery in it at this point, and it’s expanding that proportion. 
 It’s typically that a user would have to come up with an image on their own either go to a site like Shutterstock or another and license it, dig into their desktop or on their hard drive and find an image that they believe is licensable. The Facebook API now enables someone to without leaving the Facebook user interface drop in an image by searching the entire Shutterstock library in real time couple of clicks dropping an image from Shutterstock and that’s part of their, goes into their ad campaign in real time. 
 What’s interesting about this deal is it really makes that process much more efficient for the user. Facebook has decided to make that free to the end-user as a value-add because their goal obviously is to drive more advertising activity and make it easier for their customers. Facebook in turn will pay Shutterstock a fixed fee for every image that’s downloaded. And so that’s just getting going now we’re in sort of a test phase it’s live and being used by customers. So we’re optimistic that this is a model that we can use on other platforms, we’re working on those. 
 Dean Prissman 
 Very solid, so just I suppose you touched on what you’re doing from an enterprise standpoint but can we maybe elaborate. So what kind of companies that your enterprise sales team work with then what are the incremental trends and opportunities with these enterprise clients? 
 Tim Bixby 
 It’s interesting. Enterprise clients are, their needs are growing rapidly they need a lot more volume of images for the most part their budgets are not growing as fast as their image needs. And so they need more creative and cost effective ways to get images into their creative products, into their marketing campaigns. And one of the changes that we’ve helped to push over the last few years is we’ve changed the understanding that of stock photography and the quality that’s available within stock photography in libraries. 
 It was common among particularly among the enterprise marketing people, CMOs, managers, that royalty -- rights managed images were high quality and expensive and stock photography was inexpensive, low quality and low price. There was a time many years ago when there was quite a bit of truth to that that has now changed. And our enterprise sales strategy is to help enterprise buyers understand that they can also get high quality at a lower price. 
 And what we’ve done is overtime we have been able to kind of move up the value chain where while we don’t go head-to-head with the highest quality images and the highest priced most complex rights managed imagery, that’s a different part of the business that we don’t really compete in. We’ve been able to really expand and move up the value chain so that we’re able to really service a good proportion of an enterprise companies needs. If we can go from 2% or 5% or 10% of an enterprise image spend to 20% or 30% or 40%, that’s a homerun for Shutterstock. 
 Dean Prissman 
 So just sticking with enterprise so when you think about sort of this segmentation of the market and you look at obviously there is the ad agency aspect which is individual companies. How do you think about those different market opportunities? 
 Tim Bixby 
 So our customers are businesses so every business needs images. We’re going to license to a business anyway we can get at them whether it’s direct, whether it’s through an ad agency that’s been creating content. We’re advertising for an end-user whether it’s sort of an independent creative shop, that’s doing creative content on behalf of a customer, any of those routes for Shutterstock to get to an end-user and that's why we have so many different price plans that makes it most effective to get to them. 
 Now one way we have kind of shorts at this process is in the last 18 months we have executed master service agreements with five of the world's largest ad agencies so that we're now an established vendor in some cases a preferred vendor that they can now go market to all of their sub-agencies around the world of which they have dozens or hundreds. And say we now have an alternative for you to use, you don't have to stop using who you have used historically. But here is another alternative with 30 million fresh images that you probably haven't used before that's now available. It's a fixed price and we negotiate a price and it's that price that's effective for all of those agencies worldwide. 
 Dean Prissman 
 So you have seen solid payback on your customer acquisition marketing spend. Can you just discuss some of the history here and some more recent trends? 
 Tim Bixby 
 Sure, so we have pretty consistent metrics around this we, and this is really the e-commerce side of the business as it is distinguished from the enterprise sale. So we're driving a fair amount of traffic to the website, we’re doing outbound marketing. We’re using search and affiliates and another pretty typical marketing mechanisms, driving traffic to the website converting a proportion of that traffic to becoming new users. 
 The cost to acquire those users has been roughly $100 for several years and it has been consistent at that level. So we're spending more, we are growing but the overall basis is quite a bit bigger than it was a couple of years ago but those metrics have not deteriorated. We're still able to acquire it for about $100. And what we get for that $100 is a lifetime revenue of about 900 or a lifetime contribution of about 450. So spend 100 get 450, that ratio has been stable and fairly consistent for several years. And that's a pretty solid and strong ratio. 
 Dean Prissman 
 Good. So maybe we'll take some questions from the audience if we have any. So while we're gathering those. So I know you talked about 30% plus long-term EBITDA margins were the potential for those, but medium-term what is your operating philosophy as you contemplate growth versus profitability? 
 Tim Bixby 
 So currently if you look over the last say three-four quarters, we reported four quarters since becoming public. We have been looking at adjusted EBITDA metric; we have been sort of 20% to 25% of revenue. When we’re able to spend more in marketing, invest a little bit higher rate, the EBITDA margin comes down a little bit and revenue growth comes in at a higher rate. So you have kind of a nice trade out ratio that we have seen over the past several quarters. 
 Our philosophy right now is when we can do that we will do that; we'll spend at a little bit higher level. We'll let the margins come down a little bit. But we're still growing I think in a pretty small group of companies that are able to deliver 35% to 45% growth rates with EBITDA margins above 20%. So I would expect, investors should to expect us to be in that 20% to 25% EBITDA to revenue ratio over the coming several quarters. 
 Dean Prissman 
 So looking at all the growth initiatives we talked about, is there any sort of relative importance that you would attach to them and any incremental and you haven’t discussed? 
 Tim Bixby 
 I think the way we would take it down and I think we have got to hit on each of them. Expanding our localization and globalization huge opportunity, every country essentially in the world has potential for us to expand pretty significantly including the U.S., new content video footage is really the primary focus there that’s defiantly a key focus for us and then enterprise sales. They’re actually all probably fairly equal in their potential in their maturity and in fact they’re all contributing significantly today. So these are the things that we’ve invested in over the past several years that will be now coming to fruition and really driving our mid-30s to 40% growth rate. 
 I think looking out the tougher question for us is how do we sustain or maintain strong growth looking forward two or three years as the numbers get quite a bit bigger. And I’m hopeful that some of the things we’ve introduced recently the API Facebook example, we have launched a new premium brand called Offset recently these are new investments that are just starting to show some results now and I’m hopeful they’ll be those are kind of things that we’ll hopefully be able to support those growth rates over the coming years. 
 Dean Prissman 
 Right now can we have a question at the back? 
 "
XOMA," 
   XOMA Ltd. (XOMA) Piper Jaffray Healthcare Conference 2013 December  4, 2013  2:00 PM ET 
 Ted Tenthoff – Piper Jaffray 
 My clock is showing 2 o'clock, so we are going to get starting on our next presenting company, which is XOMA. My name is Ted Tenthoff, I am senior biotech analyst here at Piper Jaffray, and before I begin I am required to point out certain disclosures regarding the relationship between Piper and XOMA, which are posted both near the door and also at the registration desk. Now as many of you probably know XOMA is not a new story in biotechnology. In fact, I think that the company maybe around longer than Piper has been holding this healthcare conference. 
 John Varian 
 Possibly, 32 years I think we went. 
 Ted Tenthoff – Piper Jaffray 
 This is the 25th year, so that’s saying something. Now all of that said, a new management team led by John has really been vitalized this sleepy antibody story, and I believe that the accomplishments are pretty impressive with a lot more to come in 2014. This has clearly been reflected in XOMA share price performance of late. So here to discuss the XOMA story is a good friend, John Varian, CEO of XOMA. John, thanks for being here. 
 John Varian 
 Thank you, Ted. Thanks for having us here. I really appreciate it. 
 Ted Tenthoff – Piper Jaffray 
 Absolutely. So I am going to jump right in with gevokizumab, which is your lead antibody and it's an IL-1 Beta antibody, a little bit different activity, a little bit different mechanism than some of the competitors out there, and you are developing it presently for Behçet's and non-infectious uveitis. So if you could, at a high level, explain the mechanism of action of gevo and how this maybe useful in treating these conditions? 
 John Varian 
 Sure, I would be glad to and again thanks for having us here. So gevokizumab is our focus of the company. It's -- I say not completely kiddingly often internally, it's our number one, number two and number three priority, and we work on it with that amount of dedication to it. So gevokizumab is a monoclonal antibody that is in the allosteric modulator of the interaction between IL-1 beta and the receptor for IL-1 beta. So IL-1 beta is one of the mother cytokines within the body, and it’s involved in a series, large number of inflammatory diseases, and so the competition within the IL-1 space is anakinra Kineret, which is a drug that has been around for quite a while developed by Amgen and now being developed by Sobi, and that’s a drug that blocks the entire interaction for IL-1 and it has to be given once a day. 
 The product that is probably the closest to our molecule is Novartis’ drug Ilaris. That’s the drug that’s given once a month as is our drug. It is a monoclonal antibody also, but it's a full blocker of the interaction between IL-1 beta and the receptor. So we believe that because we allosteric modulate that interaction, we still allow that process to occur but we more normalize the process. So we think we can have the effect on the disease but normalize the IL-1 beta interaction to more of the body’s normal system. 
 Ted Tenthoff – Piper Jaffray 
 And just, I don’t mean to interrupt you, but to illustrate that a little bit more why is it important to still maintain some IL-1 beta activity? 
 John Varian 
 Now, it’s a great question and we think it gives us an advantage because IL-1 beta matters by having some remainder of that system available in the face of a serious infection, the body could still mount a response. The other thing is IL-1 beta is cleared naturally through that receptor interaction. So by not blocking it completely we allow the IL-1 beta to leave the body as opposed to creating drug and IL-1 beta conjugates that have to remain in the body. 
 Ted Tenthoff – Piper Jaffray 
 Complex. That makes sense. Now moving to Behçet's and non-infectious uveitis, tell us a little bit about these ocular conditions, ocular inflammatory conditions? 
 John Varian 
 Sure. So non-infectious uveitis is actually a syndrome, and there is often underlying disease related to the syndrome itself. There could be various different diseases including things like rheumatoid arthritis, Sarcoidosis or Behçet's. In fact 60% of the patients who have Behçet's will develop Behçet's uveitis. So it's a syndrome and what it is, it is the inflammation of the uveitis that surrounds the entire eye. What we are focused on are patients who have uveitis and it affects at least the back part of the eye. It can affect other parts of the eye but if it affects the back part of the eye, that’s our target and that would warrant a systemic therapy like gevokizumab again given once a month. 
 Ted Tenthoff – Piper Jaffray 
 So with gevo you are partnered with French Pharmaceutical company Servier. 
 John Varian 
 Right. 
 Ted Tenthoff – Piper Jaffray 
 And I think many investors at least US investors may not be as familiar with Servier. So tell us a little bit about your partner and the deal you were able to strike with them for gevo. 
 John Varian 
 Sure. It's a very unique deal. So many Americans don’t know Servier. I actually, Ted knows I worked in Paris for about three years from 2000 to 2002, so I was more familiar with them. The reason that most Americans don’t know Servier as a company as well is because Servier operates basically in every country in the world except one, and that’s the United States. So because of that, because of that bias that they will not operate within the United States, we have a very unique deal with Servier. So gevokizumab is licensed to Servier worldwide except for we retain commercial rights in the US and in Japan. 
 So it's a very unusual deal for a small company like XOMA to have a deal where we actually have full commercial rights in virtually every indication with one or two exceptions, but virtually every indication we are going to talk about today, and so because of that what we are doing is we are picking indications that we can go after at XOMA where we can actually develop the drug fully ourselves here in the US and actually market the drug by ourselves in the US. So we are picking indications whether there is a small enough number of specialty physicians who treat the patients so we can actually market the drug in the US ourselves. By doing that we think we can capture the value from gevokizumab. 
 Ted Tenthoff – Piper Jaffray 
 So we were starting to talk about Behçet’s uveitis and non-infectious uveitis. You guys are conducting three Phase 3 trials of gevo and these indications collectively called the EYEGUARD studies. Walk us through the size and design. How are these little bit different from each other? 
 John Varian 
 Yes, and so going back to something you asked earlier, but I will answer kind of now because it leads into the studies. The way non-infectious uveitis is treated is typically a patient will come in with pain or vision issues, they will be diagnosed to have non-infectious uveitis. The physician will put the patient on hydrosteroids and usually immunosuppressants. That will typically bring down the effect of the non-infectious uveitis. It has to be treated because otherwise it will lead to blindness. Okay. 
 So they treat it aggressively and then what happens is the patient will get through their non-infectious uveitis, and then the physician cannot keep the patient on the high-dose steroids because of the side effects that come from chronic use of high-dose steroids, so they start reducing down the level of steroids, and then boom and exacerbation happens again, they bring back up the steroids and this is constant battle that the physicians go through. So our studies are EYEGUARDS-A, B, and C. EYEGUARD-A is designed to treat patients who come into the physician’s office, experience an exacerbation, where they are having the inflammation at that time, and we are treating the patients with either placebo or gevokizumab. So in that case we are looking for reduction in the inflammatory response, and we can talk more specifically about it if you like. 
 EYEGUARD-C stands for controlled. Those are patients who come into the study, they are controlled on corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, and then there is a steroid tapering of prescribed steroid tapering that occurs and then you look for gevokizumab treated patients versus placebo treated patients, and look for a separation at the time of the first exacerbation. So A is active patients, C is controlled patients. By doing both of those studies we think we will have all the information that the physicians need to know how to treat patients who are under control or if they are exacerbating. 
 EYEGUARD-B is just like EYEGUARD C when it comes to steroid tapering and looking for the separation except for its only in patients who have an underlying disease of Behçet’s, and so that’s one the survey is running outside the US. What we need for we believe the submission of our BLA is we need two of those studies to be able to submit for submission of our BLA. 
 Ted Tenthoff – Piper Jaffray 
 That's helpful. I appreciate the overview. And if there any questions don’t hesitate to raise your hand, happy to make this interactive, please. 
 Unidentified Participant 
 [Inaudible]. 
 John Varian 
 So they have looked at symptoms of the Behçet’s and they seem to have activity there. They haven’t been looking at the Behçet’s uveitis as deeply as we have. And so it's a potential competitor but it's specifically in the Behçet’s patients -- of the, it's important to say, of the 150,000 patients who are estimated to have non-infectious uveitis in the US about 6,000 of those will be Behçet’s uveitis patients. 
 Ted Tenthoff – Piper Jaffray 
 Okay, please. 
 Unidentified Participant 
 Give us update on the [Inaudible]. 
 John Varian 
 Yes. So what I can say is what I said a couple of weeks ago on our conference call. So EYEGUARD-B, so let me just go through the three studies, okay? EYEGUARD B is in patients again who have Behçet’s, that’s been run by Servier. That one’s been running along well. It's on time. We expect to have results by the middle of next year. So probably May, June of next year, okay. And that’s been the time table from day one. 
 EYEGUARDs A and C those are 300-patient studies. Each one is a 300-patient study and again patients who have active disease or controlled disease. We knew going into this study that it was going to be important to have sites open to get to the patients. Anyone who has done studies in non-infectious uveitis just started with a low number of sites and then they keep increasing and increasing and increasing it. We and Servier made the conscious decision that these worldwide studies will be done in 140 centers in order to get 300 patients per study. 
 So we need about two patients per open site. So the key for us is getting sites open. So that’s what I am going to speak to well. So in -- the way that the study is designed again, we are doing the US work, Servier is doing the non-US work. In the US, 70 sites are targeted to be opened. As of our call a couple of weeks ago, we said 68 out of the 70 were open. So in the US we are getting the sites open and the enrollment is going okay. 
 Outside the US, in August when we did a call, we really had to say that Servier was having an issue with getting their countries and their sites up. But as of our call a couple of weeks ago, Servier has targeted 19 countries and 70 sites. So they are half of those total 140 sites. As of a couple of weeks ago, we were able to say that they were up to nine countries that were opened, representing 34 sites and that they also got approval in six additional countries. So now 15 out of the 19 and all that was left to happen was the shipment of drug and the customs process, which takes between 21 and 60 days. 
 So by year-end, we will have the 68 sites in the US up and Servier will have the 15 countries representing 53 sites and so with that happening, we will have way more information about the rate of enrollment because again the key is when we get the sites open, we can get we believe two patients per site on average to get the study done. 
 Ted Tenthoff – Piper Jaffray 
 Excellent. Thank you very much. So tell us a little bit about the Phase 2 data that you have generated to kind of support the mechanism that’s been -- that you are now evaluating in this Phase 3 study. 
 John Varian 
 For the non-infectious uveitis specifically. Sure. 
 Ted Tenthoff – Piper Jaffray 
 Or both, actually as you wish. 
 John Varian 
 I will stick to non-infectious uveitis and you can direct me otherwise if you would like to, okay. So what happened was about several years ago, XOMA did a study in seven patients, a very small Phase 2 study in seven patients in Turkey, who had non-infectious uveitis with an underlying disease of Behçet’s. What we saw was all the patients were treated just once and we saw that all seven patients within two days to two weeks had their inflammation resolved. So very quick and very clear effect from the drug in those patients that were treated. 
 We then followed those patients and after about a month to two, five of the patients that we were following exacerbated again. They were treated again and again all five of those patients had their inflammation resolved. Four of those five patients had stayed on the drug for over two years and seemed to be well controlled still on the drug. So we had done that work. And that was what was encouraging us and Servier to look further into this indication. Servier then has done another Phase 2 study in 21 patients and the most significant piece of information coming out of that study was that of those 21 patients, 11 of those patients had non-infectious uveitis, and had the measurement of inflammation, which is known as vitreous haze. That’s the measurement of inflammation that’s required for our endpoint in EYEGUARD-A. 
 So it is active disease study. So of those 11 patients who had a vitreous haze score of two or higher, it's a five point scale from zero to four. Of all of those 11 patients who had a vitreous haze score of two or higher, 8 out of those 11 had a reduction in their vitreous haze of at least 2 points. That is the endpoint for EYEGUARD-A study. So that was really encouraging to us because now at this point between our study and their study, there have been 12 patients who have come in the study who had vitreous haze of over 2 who had a reduction in vitreous haze of at least 2. In their study those other three patients, had a vitreous haze reduction of at least one. So all patients had their vitreous haze down and 8 out of 11 or 9 out of 12 in total now have met the endpoint that would be required an EYEGUARD-A. So that was encouraging. 
 Ted Tenthoff – Piper Jaffray 
 Excellent. And let’s have a little bit of background, what can you tell us about the powering of each of the EYEGUARD studies? 
 John Varian 
 Sure, okay. So EYEGUARD-B is an events driven study. And so EYEGUARD-B again in these Behçet’s patients, patients are 50/50 split between drug versus placebo, and we are looking for a certain number of that, okay. We haven’t disclosed the exact number of events that we are looking for. It is part of the statistical powering. Once that certain number of events hits, which again is scheduled for May to June of this year, or this next year. Once that happens, that’s when the study will be unblinded and we will get our results. 
 And so doing that study it’s again to show a separation between the Behçet’s patients with the gevokizumab versus the placebo arm, okay. In the EYEGUARD-A study, again these patients who have vitreous haze scores of at least 2 plus what we are looking for is a 45% response rate in the patients who are treated, and we are looking for a 20% placebo rate. We base that 20% placebo rate on an [Indiscernible] study that was done a few years ago. They showed about 10% placebo rate. So we are pretty conservative in studying the placebo rate. So we are looking for a 25 percentage point separation between the two. And EYEGUARD-C it's similar but again it's steroid tapering. 
 Ted Tenthoff – Piper Jaffray 
 Yes, absolutely. Perfect. So we have seen another company, [Generon] become very successful launching an antibody in ocular indications. How large are these markets and is it something that XOMA could address on their own? 
 John Varian 
 Non-infectious uveitis, absolutely. So again the sizable market is about 150,000 patients in the US. What's nice about this particular indication is as I said, we will market gevokizumab in the US on our own. We are committed to doing that. Our Chief Commercial Officer, Tom Klein, who came over from Genentech in the Spring is already putting in place the information in the systems for us to be able to do that. So what's nice about non-infectious uveitis is those patients who are not treated by a ophthalmologist. They are sent from a ophthalmologist to one or two groups. They are either sent to a uveitis specialist or to a rheumatologist. The uveitis specialist is probably less than 200 in the entire United States, and if you think about us having 70 sites up in our clinical trial, you can imagine we know quite a few of these couple of hundred uveitis specialists. 
 They see rheumatologists because often there is an underlying disease that’s related to the development of non-infectious uveitis. So between the 5,000 rheumatologists that exist in the US and these uveitis specialists, we can attack that with a very small sales force. So the market potential that we think is very good that you would expect our drug to be priced like a biologic. We won’t say more than that but you would assume to be priced as a biologic. And the market research we’ve done so far supports that that would be expected. 
 Ted Tenthoff – Piper Jaffray 
 Excellent. So we discussed early on in our conversation the broad applicability of gevokizumab for really a number of inflammatory diseases. You are conducting quite a few Phase 2s. I am going to kind of go through a couple of these now. You recently reported three month data on gevokizumab in erosive osteoarthritis of the hand. So tell us a little bit about this disease because it's actually a little bit different than maybe some people are familiar with osteoarthritis, and what the results were that you saw. 
 John Varian 
 Yeah. So that was -- we think it's a great indication and we think that for several reasons. Probably most importantly there are about 2 million people in the US who have erosive osteoarthritis of the hand. So as everyone knows osteoarthritis is a huge disease in the US probably 30 million, 40 million people have it but it's a disease of the weight bearing joints that comes from wear and tear. 
 Osteoarthritis of the hand it is similar but it's related to the hand. This specific disease that we are talking about now erosive arthritis of the hand is a distinct subset of people who have erosive -- who have osteoarthritis of the hand. Again, these 2 million people suffer more than the osteoarthritis patients dramatically. It's the only form of osteoarthritis that’s inflammatory in nature. 
 What we have seen what led us to this indication is when the joints, it typically affects just the index finger, the middle finger and the base of the thumb. And what you see when the affected joints are biopsied you see high level of IL-1 beta. So we think that’s driving it. Interestingly anakinra, again the drug I referred to earlier today or earlier in my conversation with you, that is one where it had been in a very small number of patients it was tried, and then it actually worked but again that’s the drug that is given once a day versus our drug once a month. 
 So there is good evidence for IL-1 beta and these patients [do not] nothing works for them. It's really interesting. Going into our study, 80% of the people who joined our study, so this is seriously painful syndrome with these patients coming in, 80% of the patients who came in were on no other drugs because nothing else seems to work for these patients. The main reason people didn’t come into our study was because they are on opioids, and are afraid to go off their opioids to mask the pain that they are having. 
 So nothing else really seems to work. We did our study. We started our study in erosive osteoarthritis of the hand in 90 patients, 2:1 randomized to drug versus placebo. We saw data at three months. About a month ago we reported those data and those were very encouraging to us. Now what we are looking for is the six-month data with those patients. We will have that. We will have those data along with the data in another small study that we are doing in erosive osteoarthritis of the hand and we will also have some MRI and X-ray data on those patients that zero, day zero, at 30 days, I am sorry at 3 months and a 6 months. 
 And with all that in hand which we expect to have in hand sometime in late January through February when all those data come out, with all those data in hand, we will be making the decision about should we go forward into phase 3 in erosive osteoarthritis of the hand. But it's an indication that if we can get there we think it's a really good opportunity. 
 Ted Tenthoff – Piper Jaffray 
 All right, great. Totally transformative. And then anyone have any questions. I wanted to pick up you recently announced that Pyoderma gangrenosum will be your next Phase 3 pivotal study, now this is probably a disease that a, I mispronounced and b, most people probably don’t know a single thing about. So thankfully this is not a slide presentation. So we don’t have to see the pictures. But tell us a little bit about this disease and the pivotal study that you intend to run? 
 John Varian 
 Sure. That will -- I will be glad to. So yes, it is -- you did mispronounce it. And it's a disease you don’t want to have is what I would say. No it's a very serious disease that’s driven by neutrophils in the skin. It causes lesions that are really devastating. And so when you do I would encourage you to actually look at the pictures in our presentation on our website because it's quite dramatic. So this disease is again it is driven by neutrophils. It affects only probably 3,000 to 5000 people in the US. So it's a very small population. 
 But what these people have to go through is high-dose steroids for long periods of time, TNF-alphas help but over a long period of time. What we saw in this very small pilot study that we did this last summer was in the four patients we treated we saw very good results. And those results were good enough that we decided this should be our next pivotal indication, and again if you look at what we have seen and what we continue to see with those same patients it's very compelling for us to move this forward. 
 And so what we are going to do, we started our pilot study by having a conversation with the FDA last May and got some directions. They consider this to be a very serious disease and that it's a small enough disease that we might not have to do the big broad development plan. We might be able to do an abbreviated development plan. We now have these data. We are going to submit those in a package and in the phase 2, meeting request package to FDA and then they have about 60 days to grant us the meeting, and so what we would target is that very early next year, we would be submitting the package and requesting the meeting. 
 And then we will get a agreement on what the Phase 3 pivotal study should look like. What we hope and the direction we feel like we have at this point is it would be hopefully a single study, not too large that would allow us to get approval for the drug, and if you look at similar indications, similar sized patient population that’s been not atypical but we need to have that confirmed before we actually launch those studies. 
 Ted Tenthoff – Piper Jaffray 
 And you and Servier are conducting a host of other studies and I am going to kind of move on to some other parts of the pipeline with the remaining two or three minutes that we have left. You know one of the differentiating factors as I was really doing due-diligence on XOMA and again you touched on this with gevo’s mechanism of action is this ability to uniquely allosterically modulate or develop allosteric antibodies essentially, and again this is understood in small molecules, but I really haven’t heard of anyone else doing this with the specificity of an antibody. 
 I think it's probably best exemplified by your excellent programs, which are beginning -- getting ready to approach the clinic. So tell us a little bit, these target the insulin receptor. Tell us how you are able to come out with different profiles of antibodies because of the just massive libraries that you are able to screen with. 
 John Varian 
 It is a combination of techniques, both a massive library and the ability to measure signaling almost live. And so XOMA you touched on when we started the conversation. XOMA’s science for the last 32 years has been phenomenal. What we haven’t had is a business model that really took advantage of that great science, and that’s as you can probably tell that’s what we are really focused on is implementing that kind of a business model. 
 But this is just a great example of the science at XOMA. So as you probably all know antibiotic development over the years has typically been what binds the best, what blocks the most and so it's literally find antibodies that block that interaction, stop that interaction completely. Again, the competitive drug from Novartis does exactly that. What XOMA can do is by binding to different sites on either the ligand or the receptor, we can allosterically modulate the signal and turn it up or down or almost sideways, and so with the XMet program, we have XMetA, which is an activator of the insulin receptor. 
 So an agonist to the insulin receptor, other people aren’t doing that it's because of this allosteric modulation approach. That is a drug or an antibody that we can actually use as almost basal insulin, right. So it could really change the way that insulin is used or how patients who have the type 1 or type 2 diabetes are treated. XMetS is a sensitizer, this is my example of [Indiscernible]. XMetS sensitizes the insulin receptor to insulin whether it's endogenous or exogenous, either way, and so you can imagine that if you can sensitize the insulin receptor. In animal models, we have sensitized it by 20 times more. 
 You can imagine how that could help the bodies use it's own insulin better or externally given insulin better. It could change the world about how type 1 and type 2 diabetes are treated. For those programs because the development pathway on those and because of the need for marketing, we will partner those. XMetD is a deactivator of the insulin receptor and that’s one what we think there is some orphan indications. We will take all the way forward ourselves, and actually market it ourselves in the US. 
 Ted Tenthoff - Piper Jaffray 
 Great. And we are out of time. Please, last question. 
 Unidentified Participant 
 [Indiscernible] 
 Ted Tenthoff - Piper Jaffray 
 So the question on headcount and maybe John you can throw in cash positions at 74 million how that -- how long [that lasted] or somewhat related. 
 John Varian 
 Okay. Very good question. So two years ago we took over the company. It was about 260, 270 people. We took it down to about 160, 170 and that's where we are right now, right around 170. So we have reduced the headcount and maintained that same headcount over the last couple of years. The growth has been in clinical and regulatory as you guess because we have expanded that so much. When it comes to projections for the future we don’t have massive increases until we get ready to launch our drug ourselves, and then at that point in time we will invest in the infrastructure to actually commercialize the drug, and build the sales team to do that in the US. So that would be our big major step forward in that. 
 Unidentified Participant 
 [Indiscernible] 
 John Varian 
 Yes. And so in cash we had 74 million at September 30. What we said is that takes us well into 2015. We haven’t given more guidance on that. 
 Ted Tenthoff - Piper Jaffray 
 Well, John, thank you so much for being here. I am looking forward to the data we would have in 2014. 
 John Varian 
 As am I. Thank you. Thanks Ted.

 With that, let me turn the call over to Steve for his prepared remarks, and then I will provide details regarding our third quarter results and our outlook for the rest of fiscal 2014. 
 Steve Remondi 
 Thanks, Ed, and thanks for those of you joining our call today. 
 We are pleased to see a return to double-digit growth in the third quarter. Revenue of $14.1 million increased 12% from a year ago, or 15% on a constant currency basis. Moreover, our third quarter results and improving business momentum make us increasingly confident in our ability to deliver double-digit growth for the full year. We executed well in the quarter to deliver profitability that was in the upper end of our guided range with adjusted EBITDA of $1.6 million and non-GAAP net income of $0.8 million or $0.05 per share. 
 Looking at the business trends during the quarter, the broad strength we've been seeing among passenger car OEMs and suppliers over the past several quarters continue to gain momentum. Project activity in this sector was very strong as we work with customers to handle peak engineering project needs, support new application deployment and demonstrate new capabilities. 
 Also during the third quarter, we saw some early renewal activity ahead of our busy fourth quarter renewal period and we also saw a number of mid-year upgrades as customers topped up capacity to meet the stimulation needs for the remainder of the year. 
 On the other hand, the truck and off-highway side of the ground transportation market continues to be challenged globally. While growth in the sector did not keep pace with our overall growth, we are encouraged by the initial success of our strategy to target a wider range of prospects and early signs of macro improvements in the truck and off-highway market. 
 A key ingredient to enable our customers to move to stimulation -- to a stimulation driven design process is our applications management teams. These teams are responsible for the delivery of best practices, message, validation and expertise in our core application areas, aerodynamics, thermal management and aeroacoustics. Our abilities to enable total vehicle analysis across all these disciplines is a unique differentiator that allows customers performance analysis from one stimulation model using one set of physic. 
 To further leverage this competitive differentiator, we are integrating our ground transportation, applications management teams by promoting Ales Alajbegovic, the Vice President of Ground Transportation Applications. Ales and his team have been a key -- have been key to our success in the deep deployment of aerodynamic and thermal applications over the past few years and we look forward to continuing to strive with all ground transportation applications now under his leadership. 
 By unifying our applications teams, we now have one organization focused on development and deployment of our complete solution to ground transportation market. Not only do we believe this will better leverage our development efforts, but will also help to drive the value of our broader offering to our new and existing customers. 
 From a geographic perspective, business trends continue to be very strong for customers and ground transportation in North America and Europe with strong levels of activity in the past car OEMs and suppliers. We are particularly pleased with the strong rebound of activity in Japan. The early signs we’ve been seeing of business picking up that we reported in our last call, did in fact materialize in the form of a steep sequential improvement in project activity, which we were optimistic and continue. We also continued to -- our initial efforts in penetrating the Chinese market with the signing of a license relationship with one of the largest truck OEMs in that market. 
 In order to more effectively support our efforts in Asia, we are integrating our sales and field application engineering teams in Japan, Korea and China under the new position of Vice President of Asia Sales. Kazuhito Ishikawa, who was formerly our County Manager of Japan and founded Exa's direct effort there, has been promoted to this new role. Under Kazuhito’s leadership, our team in Japan has developed key relationships with some of the largest players in the industry. 
 By combining our successful and established team in Korea and our developing team in China with our significant base in Japan, we can leverage our resources and experience across Asia as we deepen our penetration in core automotive OEMs and extend our success into the truck and off-highway and adjacent markets. 
 Turning to aerospace market, we continue to see increased project activity as aerospace becomes a more meaningful contributor to our growth. As we started pursuing this market, we first established a dedicated aerospace application management team a few years ago to validate, develop best practices and to enable customer success with early project activity. 
 Having proven our initial capabilities and confirming the market opportunity, we added a dedicated sales team to continue to drive our early success in this market. Among the drivers of this activity in this market is the new PowerFLOW 5 release, which we discussed on our last call. PowerFLOW 5 offers new capabilities that are essential for aerospace customers. 
 In particular, we saw increased revenue from customers who launched new projects to focus on reducing wind generated noise. And with long decision cycles that consist of multiple stages of increased involvement, we expect steady, positive trends in the aerospace market to continue to be a contributor to our growth over the longer term. 
 In order to provide the strategic collation of sales execution for this critical new market Jean-Paul Roux, our Senior Vice President of our European business has expanded his role to also include responsibility for building and driving a dedicated global aerospace sales, field and application management team. Jean-Paul joined Exa 12 years ago to lead our European sales effort and has grown that organization to one that generates approximately half of Exa’s revenue. 
 In addition, we have promoted Swen Noelting who led our initial [effort in] aerospace to the role of Vice President of Aerospace Applications Management as part of Jean-Paul's expanded leadership team. The expanded role that Jean-Paul, Swen, Kazuhito and Ales are picking on; also put our long term goals to leverage our leadership position in the transportation industry and to accelerate the deployment of our stimulation solutions across multiple end markets and geographies. 
 Strengthening our organization to position the company for our next phase of growth has been a focus of mine and you can expect to see additional announcements to reflect this goal as we continue to scale. 
 Turning to technology and products, our recent launch of PowerFLOW 5 is being well received among existing customers and prospects who have started to evaluate integrating its capabilities into their processes. Along with our PowerFLOW 5 release, we also recently introduced the third generation of PowerACOUSTICS, our noise transmission and analysis package and the second generation of PowerDELTA, our simulation model preparation package. 
 For passenger cars, trains, airplanes and heavy equipment, reducing wind-generated noise is a key factor meeting both customer satisfaction and government regulatory requirements, thus manufacturers are keenly interested in mitigating unnecessary noise inside the cabin up to the surrounding community. The latest release of PowerACOUSTICS allows manufactures to predict noise transmission into the cabin from any combination of noise source including wind, road, tire, engine and a glass sources. 
 Our visualization tools help engineers quickly understand these impacts to help evaluate design trade-offs to reduce the wind generated noise by the vehicle shape or from fan. The accuracy of design analysis also depends on the quality of geometric models. PowerDELTA helps to automate the process of preparing simulation models for the flexible template-driven approach. 
 However, rapid design exploration and automated optimization of designs requires an integrated high quality morphing capability that allows engineers and designers to rapidly create [what if] geometrics as they work under tight time schedules to define designs that meet both their performance and aesthetic targets. 
 With our latest release the power -- the morphing capability of PowerCLAY has now been merged into PowerDELTA, providing an integrated geometric model filled in modified package. 
 In summary, we are pleased with the performance in the third quarter. We saw a return of double-digit growth and we expect that we expect to sustain in the full year based on new tactics and strategies we are implementing to pursue the opportunity ahead, but we are not done. 
 We believe we have significant opportunity to further improve our sales productivity that drive broader reach to new customers and deepen penetration within existing customers in the years ahead. We are pleased with the improving growth trends we have seen over the last several quarters as a result of investment in technology, product and sales. We continue to see opportunities to invest in our core markets and expand our markets into new markets that will enable us to continue to deliver double-digit growth as we look forward to fiscal 2015 and beyond. 
 Before I turn the call over to Ed, I’d also like to thank him for his efforts on Exa's behalf over the past ten years. As you know, Ed will be resigning as CFO and COO at the end of March. We are grateful to Ed's many contributions that have been made that have been instrumental to our growth and evolution as a company including the completion of our initial public offering last year. His decision to stay on Board for five months to ensure smooth transition reflects the character that has made Ed such a strong leader here. 
 Now I’ll pass the call over to Ed for more details about our financial performance and outlook. 
 Ed Furlong 
 Thanks Steve. I'll discuss our third quarter results and then provide you with our guidance for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2014. 
 Revenue in the third quarter was within our guidance range at $14.1 million, up 12% from the same period a year ago. On a constant currency basis, revenue increased 15% from the third quarter of fiscal 2013. From a geographic perspective, 50% of our third quarter revenue was from Europe, with 22% from the Americas and 28% from Asia and other regions, with year-over-year increases in Europe outpacing other regions. 
 Within revenue, license revenue was $11.1 million, up 8% from a year ago or 10% on a constant currency basis. Project revenue of $3.0 million in the third quarter increased 30% from a year ago or 35% on a constant currency basis. 
 We will discuss our profitability measures on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis and have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures in our earnings press release issued today, with the only difference as being stock-based compensation expenses and amortization of acquired intangibles. 
 Looking at the P&amp;L, total GAAP operating expenses were $13.4 million, an increase of 15% from a year ago due to planned investments throughout our organization to support our growth and public company costs. This resulted in GAAP income from operations of $0.7 million compared to $0.9 million in the year-ago period. 
 GAAP net income in the third quarter was $0.5 million or $0.04 per share based on 14.7 million weighted average basic shares outstanding, at the upper end of our expected ranges. This compares to GAAP net income of $0.2 million or $0.01 per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2013. 
 GAAP expenses include $0.4 million in stock-based compensation expenses and $0.5 million in amortization of intangible assets. Excluding these non-cash items, non-GAAP operating income was $1.1 million compared to non-GAAP operating income of $1.2 million a year ago. 
 For the third quarter, we generated $1.6 million in adjusted EBITDA, which was within our guidance range and consistent with adjusted EBITDA of $1.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2013. 
 Non-GAAP net income in the third quarter was $0.8 million compared to non-GAAP net income of $0.4 million in the year-ago period, with 14.7 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding, non-GAAP net income was $0.05 per share in the third quarter compared to $0.03 in the year-ago period based on 14.6 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. 
 Turning to some highlights of our balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with $25.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, a decrease of $7.6 million from $33.0 million at the end of the second quarter reflecting normal cash flow seasonality. Cash flow from operations for the third quarter was an outflow of $7.0 million compared with an outflow of $5.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2013. 
 We expect to see normal seasonal patterns for cash flow for the remainder of the year as revenue is recognized ratably for annual contracts and we expect to end the year with positive cash flow from operations. Total deferred revenue was $12.1 million at the end of the third quarter, an increase from $9.6 million a year ago, but a decrease from $17.9 million at the end of the second quarter, reflecting typical seasonal trends since most license renewals occur in the fourth and second quarters. 
 Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2014, we are pleased with our return to double-digit revenue growth in the third quarter. Customers continue to see strong value from stimulation-based design and we continue to make investments in our growth including increasing sales productivity. A combination of these factors validates our continued investment strategy and make us confident that we can deliver double-digit revenue growth on a full year basis. 
 For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we anticipate revenue in the range of $14.2 million to $15.7 million. We anticipate adjusted EBITDA in the range of $0.6 million to $1.8 million. We anticipate GAAP net income or loss in the range of a loss of $0.2 million to income of $0.4 million. We anticipate NON-GAAP net income to range from $0.1 million to $0.7 million and we estimate basic share count of 13.4 million shares and fully diluted share count of approximately 14.8 million shares for the fourth quarter. 
 Based on our third quarter results and fourth quarter guidance, our updated guidance for the fiscal year ending January 2014 is as follows. We anticipate revenue in the range of $53.5 million to $55.0 million, which represents a narrower range from prior guidance, but with a mid point that is unchanged representing growth of 11% or 14% on a constant currency basis. 
 We anticipate adjusted EBITDA in the range of $3.1 million to $4.2 million. We anticipate GAAP net loss in the range of $1 million to $0.4 million and we anticipate non-GAAP net income of between breakeven to $0.6 million. We estimate basic share count of 13.4 million shares and fully diluted share count of 14.7 million shares for the year. 
 Our guidance assumes an exchange rate of US$1.35 per euro and 100 Japanese yen to the U.S. dollar for the remainder of fiscal 2014, while we will provide detailed guidance for fiscal 2015 on our fourth quarter call, we believe that double-digit growth we expect to see in fiscal 2014 will continue into 2015. 
 We are seeing positive results from investments across our organization and in the fourth quarter and into fiscal 2015, we expect to make incremental investments that will continue to support our long term growth. While these investments may restrict our near term margin expansion, we believe this strategy will support our continued expansion and strengthen our market leadership and ultimately product higher long term shareholder value. 
 In summary, we are pleased to see increases in overall customer activity, especially in our automotive customers though continued delays in some end-market persist. Nonetheless, we remain confident in our ability to deliver double-digit revenue growth in fiscal 2014 and into fiscal 2015. 
 Before turning over the call to questions, I wanted to add a personal note, I am proud to have been a part of the Exa team for over 10 years and through the company's evolution to being a public company. While still in early stages our transition planning is proceeding smoothly. I've enjoyed work with all our constituents, employees, customers and of course shareholders. 
 With that, operator, can you now open the call for questions?

 Aart J. de Geus 
 Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. I'm happy to report that we closed a very good quarter and achieved excellent 2013 results. We're seeing strong product and customer momentum, and we're positioned well as we head into 2014. 
 Summarizing our results, we delivered revenue of $505 million in Q4 and $1.962 billion for the fiscal year, a 12% increase over 2012. We reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.56 in Q4 and $2.44 for the year. This is 16% growth over fiscal 2012 and substantially above the target range communicated at the beginning of the year. Simultaneously, we increased our non-GAAP ops margin to 24% for the year and generated $497 million in operating cash flow. With strong multiyear commitments by a number of key customers, we grew our 3-year backlog to $3.1 billion. Lastly, we continued to diversify and broaden our product portfolio, with strong momentum in IP and Systems. 
 Building on a very solid year-end position, we're setting a 2014 non-GAAP EPS objective of $2.55 to $2.60 and a revenue target of $2.06 billion to $2.085 billion. Brian will discuss these in more detail shortly. 
 Before providing some highlights for the year, let me comment on the customer landscape. As you've seen, 2013 has been a year of gradual and uneven economic recovery across the globe. Against this backdrop, the semiconductor market, while forecasted to show modest growth in 2013, remains highly competitive. To prosper, our customers must excel in both cost and time-to-market while accelerating their adoption of disruptive new technology such as FinFET transistors, 20 and 16, 14 process geometries and multi-pattern masks. While we have not seen a material change in customer behavior, we realize that 2013 is another year in an extended period of uncertainty, and customers have remained somewhat cautious. Nonetheless, they are willing to spend on technology that enables them to differentiate. This is great for Synopsys, as many key customers are specifically counting on us to accelerate their differentiation and speed their time-to-market. 
 Driving growth of the market are the 3 segments of mobile, cloud infrastructure and what can be summarized as ""Smart Everything,"" also known as the Internet of Things. The mobile market shows very good growth, which is projected to continue well into the future, albeit with a shifting mix towards more lower-cost devices. The customers in this markets are particularly counting on Synopsys, as they require both advanced FinFET technology and substantial amounts of IP. 
 The increasing number of mobile devices, combined with massive Internet search, social applications and video, in turn drives continued demand for cloud infrastructure capacity. This bodes well for Synopsys, as servers and Internet infrastructure use the most challenging silicon technology and EDA optimizations for speed and low power. 
 The third category of smart everything is readily visible in the automotive segment, for example. Today's cars include hundreds of sensors, dozens of electronic control units, extensive network systems and millions of lines of software code, which can already exceed 20% of a car's total cost. The electronic and software content will continue to grow as increasingly smart and powerful driving assistance features are added. Integrating these complex hardware/software systems is a real challenge, necessitating the adoption of the types of hardware/software prototyping tools that Synopsys pioneered over the last decade. 
 The outlook is especially promising for top-tier customers, who are demanding the most advanced tools, design flows, global support and sophisticated IP. For many of them, we're already their preferred collaboration partner, and their multiyear commitment to Synopsys, reflected in our backlog, has allowed us to invest substantially in new technology that we'll be introducing over the next 18 months. 
 Let me provide some technical highlights, starting with implementation. The move to advanced silicon nodes continues unabated as customers seek to take advantage of considerable power, performance and area benefits. During Q4, we saw the number of designs for 22-nanometer and 14-, 16-nanometer increased notably. This has a positive impact on us, as Synopsys is the acknowledged leader at these geometries. Approximately 90% of 20-nanometer-and-below tape-outs have used Synopsys implementation tools. We're already engaged all the way down to 10-nanometer in design and at 7-nanometer with TCAD. The design activity on 14-, 16-nanometer FinFET processes is accelerating. Foundries are under pressure to stabilize their process and provision the necessary IP. Design houses are under pressure to execute their first designs, and we expect that during 2014 and early '15, pressure will mount to ramp yield. These are all areas where Synopsys plays a central role. Competitively, Synopsys has at least a year ahead start. Our complete solution, from earliest stages with TCAD to digital and analog mixed-signal design and verification to IP and global support, is unmatched. Our FinFET solutions are also production proven, with well over 100 million FinFET chips in the market today that were designed with Synopsys tools. 
 During the past year, we announced a number of customer and ecosystem partner successes. TSMC certified both our digital and custom design and verification solutions for its 16-nanometer FinFET process and awarded us partner of the year for joint development of their 16-nanometer FinFET design infrastructure. 
 We were also presented TSMC's partner of the year award for interface IP for the fourth consecutive year. Samsung chose Synopsys as their FinFET partner because of the successful collaboration history and our complete solution. We enabled the tape-out of Samsung's first 14-nanometer low-power test chip and delivered a comprehensive design implementation flow for its leading-edge 14-nanometer FinFET process. 
 We announced UMC's first qualification tape-out in its 14-nanometer FinFET process, achieved using Synopsys tools. Our early collaboration with GLOBALFOUNDRIES helped accelerate availability of their 14nm-XM process for the mobile market. 
 Achronix standardized on IC Compiler and IC Validator and taped out the industry's first commercial FinFET-based complex FPGA using our tools. 
 In addition, in 2014, we plan to roll out next-generation capabilities that will enable notably faster design than anything seen so far. This is the result of many years of R&amp;D, and the initial collaborations show outstanding results that will materially impact the competitiveness of our customers. 
 Moving to verification. These increasingly complex chips require an immense amount of complex simulation, emulation, prototyping, verification IP and debug tools. Leading customers rely on us in this area as well, with approximately 70% of advanced digital designs utilizing Synopsys and 19 of the top 20 semiconductors counting on our analog circuit simulation. 
 In 2013, we embarked on the development and assembly of a major new verification platform. First, we completed our solution through the acquisitions on EVE, with the industry's fastest emulator, and SpringSoft, with the gold-standard debug tool. Since then, we have mounted a massive effort to develop a next-generation verification platform. The customers response has been excellent, and hereto, we have a strong pipeline of capabilities that will be rolled out over the next 18 months. 
 Finally, our IP and Systems products continue to grow very nicely, now representing approximately 25% of revenue. Synopsys is the second largest IP provider in the world and #1 in interface, analog and memory segments. Outsourcing of standard-based IP continues to increase. We estimate that just over about 50% is outsourced today. With a potential TAM of $4 billion to $5 billion, there's plenty of runway for continued Synopsys growth in IP. 
 Our track record of quality and efficiency, plus the increased complexity of the IP we are delivering, means that our customers not only save money buying for Synopsys, but also accelerate their schedules and de-risk their chips. During the past year, we continued to deliver highly sophisticated products, including memory IP and logic libraries for a number of 14-, 16-nanometer FinFET processes. Looking into 2014, we expect FinFET-based IP to grow as design in these technology accelerates. Simultaneously, we have embarked on next-generation interface protocols such as DDR4, PCI Express Gen 4, USB 3.1 and HDMI 2.0, all significantly more complex and, thus, promising for our continued growth. 
 Given the sophistication of our IP teams, we are very involved in the development of new standards to best meet initial customer demands. For example, after working for 2 years as part of the HDMI Forum to architect the 2.0 specification, we launched our digital and analog cores just 1 day after the Forum ratified the specification. We have subsequently closed HDMI 2.0 deals with a number of customers in applications such as ultra high def 4k TV, video cameras and tablets. 
 In summary, amid a customer environment characterized by a mix of economic uncertainty and aggressive investment in design, Synopsys is in a very good position with product and customer momentum, as well as a financial base that supports continued execution and investment. We performed well in 2013 and look at 2014 as a year to expand our technology and market leadership. Our primary economic objective is to drive high single-digit non-GAAP earnings per share expansion. 
 We plan to achieve our goal through a combination of the following: one, drive traditional EDA organic revenue growth generally in the low to mid-single-digit range; two, achieve IP and Systems organic revenue growth generally in the low double digits; three, continue to grow non-GAAP operating margins solidly into the mid-20s through continued global focus in operational efficiency; four, actively explore value- and TAM-expanding M&amp;A; and five, optimize the use of our strong cash flow through a balance of M&amp;A, debt reduction and/or stock buybacks. 
 I'll now turn the call over to Brian Beattie. 
 Brian M. Beattie 
 Well, thank you, Aart, and good afternoon, everyone. In my comments today, I will summarize our financial results for the quarter and fiscal year and provide you with our guidance for Q1 and the full year of 2014. In my discussions, all of my comparisons will be year-over-year unless I specify otherwise. Now, as a reminder, FY '12 included an extra fiscal week, affecting both revenue and total expenses by $25 million and $16 million, respectively. 
 Synopsys delivered a solid fourth quarter, wrapping up an outstanding year. FY '13 financial results were highlighted by double-digit growth in both revenue and non-GAAP earnings and considerable free cash flow generation. Additionally, we significantly exceeded our original 2013 target for operating cash flow and continued our stock repurchase program. Q4 total revenue increased 11% to $505 million. Annual revenue grew 12% to $1.962 billion, the third consecutive year we've delivered double-digit growth. This, of course, includes the revenue contribution from our fiscal 2012 acquisitions. But even excluding these transactions, business was very solid. 
 We met our original 2013 revenue growth targets, even in the context of the significant yen depreciation this year, due to our stronger business models. About 90% of Q4 revenue came from beginning-of-quarter backlog, and one customer accounted for approximately 11% of Q4 and fiscal year revenue. The weighted average duration of our renewable customer license commitments for the quarter was about 3 years. For all of fiscal 2013, it was greater than 3.5 years, reflecting a mix of contracts, including the impact of a large contract renewal in Q2. We currently expect average duration for FY '14 to be approximately 3 years. 
 Three-year backlog increased to $3.1 billion from $2.7 billion, with just over $1.5 billion scheduled to be recognized as revenue in fiscal 2014. Taking into account the impact of our larger hardware sales and the continued strength in IP, we have approximately 75% of our target fiscal 2014 revenue in hand for the coming year. 
 Turning to expenses. Q4 total GAAP costs and expenses were $454 million, which included $30.5 million of amortization of intangible assets and $18 million of stock-based compensation. For the year, total GAAP costs and expenses were $1.716 billion, which included $127.5 million of amortization of intangible assets and $67.5 million of stock-based compensation. 
 Q4 total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $396 million. For the full year, total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $1.491 billion, an expected increase due to headcount and expenses from our 2012 acquisitions, primarily SpringSoft and EVE, along with year-over-year increases such as employee compensation and planned hiring. 
 Non-GAAP operating margin was 21.7% for the quarter and 24% for the full year, the second consecutive year of margin expansion. For all of FY '14, we expect an increase in non-GAAP operating margin similar to that of FY '13. Our ongoing goal continues to be the focus of operational efficiency with annual non-GAAP operating margins moving solidly into the mid-20s. 
 Turning now to earnings. GAAP earnings per share were $0.36 for the quarter and $1.58 for the year. Q4 non-GAAP earnings per share increased 19% to $0.56, while full year non-GAAP earnings grew 16% to $2.44. This is the third consecutive year in which we've substantially exceeded our high single-digit EPS growth objective. Non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 21% for both Q4 and the full year. Now, as a reminder, the full year 2013 reflects the reinstated R&amp;D tax credit for both FY '12 and '13, which benefited FY '13 earnings by approximately $0.12. For modeling purposes, we think that a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 24% is a reasonable estimate for all of fiscal 2014. 
 Now turning to our cash flow. We generated $191 million in cash from operations in Q4 and $497 million for all of fiscal 2013. FY '13 operating cash flow exceeded our original expectations, due primarily to higher-than-planned business levels and cash collections experienced throughout the year. We repaid $7.5 million of our outstanding term loan in Q4 and $30 million for the full year, leaving a remaining balance of $105 million. During the quarter, we purchased about 2 million shares of Synopsys stock for $75 million. For all of fiscal 2013, we spent $145 million repurchasing about 4 million shares. Yesterday, the board replenished its share repurchase authorization to $500 million. 
 We ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $1 billion, with 46% onshore and 54% offshore. At this time, we're targeting operating cash flow of $425 million to $450 million in FY '14. We plan to continue optimizing the use of our strong cash flow, whether on M&amp;A, debt reduction or stock buybacks. 
 Finally, we expect our operating cash flow quarterly profile to be similar to last year, with a net operating cash outflow during the first quarter of fiscal 2014, due primarily to the timing of our prior year annual incentive compensation payments. 
 Capital expenditures were $18 million for the quarter and $65 million for the year. For fiscal 2014, we expect capital spending of approximately $130 million. The increase was primarily facilities related, including a 2-year project to build out a newly leased Bay Area facility that will replace several current buildings and several projects related to past acquisitions. 
 DSO was 46 days, reflecting the timing of invoices, and we ended Q4 with approximately 8,570 employees with about 1/3 in lower-cost geographies. 
 So now let's address our first quarter and fiscal 2014 guidance. For the first quarter of FY '14, our targets are revenue between $475 million and $485 million. As we communicated last year, we expect some increased variability in quarterly revenue going forward. This can be driven by factors such as sales volatility in emulation and prototyping hardware, which generates upfront revenue; timing of IP consulting projects and royalties; and certain contracts where revenue is recognized when customer installment payments are received. 
 However, we continue to expect a revenue model that's approximately 90% time based. Total GAAP costs and expenses between $422 million and $444 million, which includes approximately $18 million of stock-based compensation expense. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $377 million and $387 million. Other income and expense between $6 million and $8 million, which includes a gain associated with a previous investment. A non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 24%. Outstanding shares between 154 million and 158 million. GAAP earnings of $0.30 to $0.38 per share, and non-GAAP earnings of $0.51 to $0.53 per share. 
 So now, looking at fiscal 2014, our outlook is for revenue between $2.06 billion and $2.085 billion, a growth rate of approximately 5% to 6%. We note an approximate 1 percentage point headwind -- it's not material, but it results from the devalued yen rates that we locked in during 2013; other income and expense between $7 million and $10 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 24%; outstanding shares between 154 million and 158 million; GAAP earnings per share of $1.69 to $1.82, including impact of approximately $78 million in stock-based compensation expense; non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.55 to $2.60, a growth rate of approximately 5% to 7%. And as I mentioned, FY '13 earnings reflect the approximate $0.12 benefit from the reinstated R&amp;D tax credit, and we are targeting cash flow from operations of $425 million to $450 million. 
 Now finally, to help you with your modeling, let me provide some brief commentary on our 2014 revenue and expense profile. At this time, we expect second half revenue to be a bit higher than our first half revenue, with Q4 higher than both Q2 and Q3, which are similar. At this point, we expect total non-GAAP expenses to be skewed slightly towards the second half of the year. 
 In summary, we're pleased with our fourth quarter and full year financial performance, highlighted by double-digit top and bottom line growth, solid operating margins and strong cash flow generation. 
 And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.

   Dennis P. Kelleher 
 Good afternoon. Just a quick one on my team with me, I got Chris Bohn here with me who is our Vice President of Planning and I've also got with me our Director of IR, Dan Swenson. So they'll be joining me for Q&amp;A. 
 What I'd like to do is and some of you will recognize this slide. This slide comes originally from our IPO deck that we did back in 2005. And really I don't want to talk about it because the IPO is past us but I just want to make a couple of comments about sort of where we've been. 
 And that is as you know we've got a CEO transition coming up earlier in January of 2014. And the way we like to think about that is that really moving from one chapter to another chapter in the same book. Over the past seven or eight years certainly since our IPO, the company has really been a great corporate transformation story from a cooperative that earns gross margin in some years of less $100 million to a public company today where we're in the billions of dollars on that metric. 
 What's important I think is as we transition from Tony to Steve and as we think about all the stuff that has gotten us from where we were in 2003, '05, '07, whatever the case maybe to where we are today, both Tony and Steve have had a very integral – played very integral parts in all of the decisions really to transform the company and made it what it is today. 
 So as we talk about what we're doing today and what we're talking about doing in the future, what I'd like to just think is that that really is just a logical extension of what we have done in the past and reflects not just new initiatives but things that we have been thinking about for quite a while. Maybe we're articulating in a little bit differently today but I can assure you that these are things that we think about on an ongoing basis with the management team and also with our Board. 
 Just real quickly, you're all aware in 2005 we were a fertilizer company with three nitrogen complexes and a phosphate business. At the time we had gross margin of $209 million and we had a market cap of $800 million. As we wind the clock ahead to the end of 2010 after we purchased Terra, we had gross margin of $1.2 billion and we had a market capitalization of $9.6 billion. And obviously today we stand at something greater than $12.5 billion. We're still capped [ph] into the share price. 
 On the far right-hand side of the chart we talked about optimization and really that's how we think about where we are today. We're in the process of optimization. And what does that actually mean? Well, what it means is we're going to continue to expand our nitrogen capacity as we're doing it at Port Neal and Donaldsonville and we'll look at smaller projects obviously as we always have. And the other plan we're divesting the phosphate business which is an announcement you all would have heard recently. 
 And then we're also continuing our share repurchase program in an aggressive fashion as we have done for quite some time now. And you probably had all seen the slides by now and given you sort of a little bit like yesterday's New York Times but we're also talking about significantly increasing our balance sheet efficiency for return of a debt issuance of around $1.5 billion early next year. 
 So that's kind of how we're thinking about our business with where we are today. And I think it's worth looking at as we had our 1,200% return on our share price since our IPO which is a phenomenal result, it's worth looking at how that compares to our competitors' debt in the sector. And what you'll find is if you (indiscernible) look at any of the milestones that I've got shown here on the graph, you'll see that CF from a total shareholder returns perspective outperforms our competitive price significantly no matter what timeframe you want to look at on this page. And we think that that's a really important part of our story. 
 As we look here, I'd say part of that and it's a big part of why we've been able to produce those returns we believe is the disciplined approach that we have had to capital allocation since the company went public and certainly before that. And you sort of think about that in three buckets if you look back. We had $6.4 billion in the last three years of operating cash flow and how do we deploy that operating cash flow? Well, we did some organic investments which would include debottleneck, maintenance CapEx that also includes some CapEx that sits on our major projects at Port Neal and Donaldsonville. 
 Now we've also done some what I would call quality [ph] investment that is the $900 million we spent to buy 34% interest in Medicine Hat that we didn't own. Those two things taken together as you can see amount to about 38% of the operating cash flow we generated over the period. We also spent 18% of that operating cash flow on some other things mostly retired Terra acquisition debt that was of short-term nature and also that reflects cash flow that goes to our non-controlling interest in our consolidated but not wholly-owned subsidiaries of (indiscernible) also at the time. 
 Most importantly I think we had $3 billion or 44% of the operating cash flow returned to shareholders and that's been largely in form of as you can see share repurchases but also we've had dividends and dividend increases along the way. So we think that's a pretty good track record and we believe that that's part of why we've achieved some of the returns we've achieved. But I think everything it stands in relation to how you sit versus your competitors' sit and I think on that metric, we stack up pretty well as well. Again, we had 44% and the closest competitor to that 44% was Potash at 36%. Everybody else was significantly lower than ourselves over the same period. So I think a pretty fantastic result. 
 But that's all the history and I think what you're most interested in today is what are we thinking about today and where are we going? And I think a really good place to start is to start with the capital structure. And you know that we achieved investment grade credit rating from Moody's and S&amp;P in 2012. We're proud of having done that and it was hard work to get to that point and we believe it's an important place for us to stay and we're committed to trying to stay there. 
 We also in 2013 did our inaugural investment grade debt offering for $1.5 billion and most of you will recall that consisted of $750 million of debt that we issued for 10 years at 3.45% and $750 million that we issued at 4.95% for 30 years; the 30 years tenure being enabled by among other things but very importantly our investment grade credit rating. 
 If you look at the graph on the right to point out – the place I want to point you to is really the green bar on the left underneath optimal mid cycle range. We believe as we look ahead that the debt on our balance sheet that we would be comfortable with that fits within the metric 2.0x to 2.5x mid cycle EBITDA. As we think about the next step and I mentioned this earlier, in early 2014 we intend to issue $1.5 billion in long-term debt. 
 Two points I'd like to make on that. We believe that $1.5 billion fits comfortably within the optimal mid-cycle range of 2 to 2.5 and we also believe that it fits well within our investment grade credit framework. In the past some of you probably heard me say that there's a fair amount of blue water between where we (indiscernible) with respect to how much debt was on our balance sheet and where we'll be bumping up against investment grade credit metric limit. 
 And what I would say today is obviously with the $1.5 billion debt offering there is significantly less blue water but there's still a bit of blue water left. But this is the initiative that we're able to talk about today with some granularity. And that is just obviously a significant material step again for making our balance sheet more capital efficient. 
 But that's not all that we do and I want that to be clear and I think that this is the slide that perhaps it's got people rather excited and I want to just talk about this in a way that's reflected in how we're thinking about it. At this company we have always looked at different funding options for what we do as you would expect us to do. So we have looked at and in fact have executed as well as secured again in the near future investment grade debt offering. 
 There are other things that we are in the process of looking at as well. Including those would be probably finance, securitization and most importantly MLP structures. And what we've done in that regard is we're working with two bulge bracket investment banks who operate in a material fashion in this space, that is the MLP space, on a daily basis and what we have asked them to do is two things. One, help us break through [ph] and understand what is a MLP, what is the MLP structure, what is the market, how does it work, basic understanding of the whole space. And two, ask them to look at specific opportunities within CF for utilizing the MLP structure as the potential financing vehicle. 
 Again, I discussed these are studies and there has been no conclusion. The study is underway and it will be in process into 2014, but I don't have any granularity as to exactly when it will be done. I don't know exactly what the banks' recommendation may or may not be as we get through that, but it's an important piece of work that we believe in fiduciary responsibility to our shareholders we need to do. These are independent studies and objective studies. 
 To put it in analogy we have asked each of these banks to go off and look at their own watches and come back and tell us what time they think it is. We've not asked them to look at our watches and (indiscernible) to what the time we think it is. And so that's important. So that's something that we will be considering as we go forward. Whatever recommendation comes out of this if any, whatever that may be, it will be considered by management and Board in terms of how it creates long-term sustainable value for our existing shareholders just as we do when we look at any financing alternative or any project alternative that the company's looked at. 
 So that's it for the sources. Why don't we talk a little bit about the uses of funds and we think about uses of funds really in three buckets; sustaining the base, focus and accretive growth and cash returned to shareholders. When we think about sustaining the base and like I said we're committed to our investment grade credit rating. 
 And the reason for that for us is twofold. One, our investment grade credit rating has allowed us to issue long-dated 30-year, 20-year on average capital at very low rate. When I think of 30-year capital in particular, 20-year on average capital it's really like having equity that you finance – it's like having low coupon tax deductible equity only debt refinance [ph] is still far out. And so that's something that obviously – the benefit of that we availed ourselves off in the past and we'll be doing that again here in the near future. 
 In addition to that we believe that the investment grade credit rating also helps us add the financial flexibility and a bit of dry powder so that if a big project or if a big M&amp;A activity or a big M&amp;A opportunity were to come along, we've got the ability to execute that in an expeditious and capital efficient fashion. And so we think that represents a good balance for us being in that space. 
 On focused and accretive growth, I want to really talk about that in terms of examples. If you think about our strategy and I think we've articulated that pretty well and if you look at the actions we've taken, I think that that underlines that. Our (indiscernible), if you will, strategy stairway feedback really is in nitrogen production buyers towards North America because a, we're there and b, it's a tremendous big process advantage place to do that business. 
 And so along those lines we've invested in some projects that you all know about; our project in Port Neal and in Donaldsonville and also the acquisitions of 34% interest in Medicine Hat that we did now because those projects fit – they go right down our strategic stairway and they have compelling risk adjusted returns associated with them, and we'll get into a little bit more about the projects later in the presentation. You've probably already seen it. 
 On the focused side what I would talk about really are two things. First and because it's the most comparable is the phosphate sale. As time has gone by we acquired share and we're growing our nitrogen business. Phosphate just simply wasn't as strategically important to the company as it had been in the past particularly before the Terra transition. In addition, the opportunities to do a deal with Mosaic who we believe is the logical buyer for these assets because their assets surround ours and they have the largest synergy opportunity, that opportunity arose. 
 Independent of that but at the same time we also entered into an ammonia supply contract with Mosaic, so (indiscernible) seeing 600,000 and 800,000 tons of ammonia per year on a gas plus pricing basis. That supply contract with Mosaic goes a long way to understanding our belief that the project we're investing our shareholders' money will give returns in the mid-teens. So all of that really if you look at that close together, it really is about focused and accretive growth. 
 But I think it's also worth mentioning from a capital perspective you all know that at one point in time we had considered investing in a nitrogen complex in Peru. For a lot of reasons that didn't work out and we're very happy today that we didn't pursue that opportunity because the opportunities we're pursuing say in Louisiana and Iowa are certainly much better from a cost perspective and a risk adjusted returns perspective. So we are also very good at saying no to things when those things don't fit within our strategic stairway and when we got (indiscernible) returns that we expect. 
 And then cash returns to shareholders, this is also very important. You'll know that we announced today that we had purchased 665,000 shares, so that brings our share count down, I think to about 56.6 if I do the math right in our last 10-Q, so about $144 million at about $217 per share. We had $1.7 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization of the 3 billion that we announced last year. What I'd like to say about that is we are cognizant of the fact that we have two significant liquidity events in the offering in 2014. One, we've got the $1.5 billion debt offering and two, we've got approximate $1 billion of net after tax proceeds associated with phosphate. And operating cash flow will develop as we – I think will develop as we think it will develop. And so while I cannot commit to this today and I am not committing to this today, it would not be a surprise if towards the end of 2014 or beginning of 2015 the $1.7 billion of remaining authorization were exhausted. 
 We have obviously continued to evaluate the dividend over time. We've made changes to the dividend on a number of occasions as you all know, most recently being across the share – the dividend up to $1 per quarter or $4 per year. That's something that we evaluate on an ongoing basis to the part we evaluate share repurchases and everything else, because this time it's possible that there may be changes to that as well. 
 In addition, there was (indiscernible) to account the money we were going to spend on the project expansion and potential we would see what happens if something develops in a way of an additional project at some point in time or M&amp;A activity at some point in time which we don't have any visibility to or not very much visibility to today. We expect to have significant cash flows available for additional distribution to shareholders. 
 I think it's worth spending some time on the next chart because it really sort of starts to put this thing in sort of a quantitative frame, and what I'd like to do is just look at it just in a (indiscernible) uses perspective. If you look on the left-hand side of the chart you see the force [ph] of this capital as we see them today. We have an existing cash balance as of 9/30/2013 of $3.3 billion. We were planning a long-term debt offering of up to $1.5 billion and we've got the $1 billion that I referred to earlier in the phosphate sale. 
 Then sitting above that in a shaded blue line is an illustrative range of what operated cash flow between 2014 and 2016 might be. You all have your own view of what that is based on your forecast for fertilizer prices and gas prices, but that's just for illustrative purposes. As we look to the right-hand side and we talk about uses, from a liquidity perspective we see ourselves meeting our ongoing basis $1.5 billion – in that range $1.5 billion of total liquidity – excuse me, in the range of $500 million of cash sitting on top our $1 billion investment grade credit quality revolving credit facility. And probably then I'll provide a significant really cash as well from where we stand today. 
 We also have sustaining CapEx of around $350 million per year to keep our assets running and stay compliant in an efficient manner which we intend to do. We've got $3.1 billion that we have yet to spend on our capacity expansion project in Donaldsonville and Port Neal. And we've got a existing dividend in this particular yellow – I think it's yellow, maybe it's I'm not sure looks brown or yellow something like that in that particular bar we're assuming that it's the existing dividends assuming that the share count of 57.3 which was as the last two that's in place obviously and things are developing as we've already announced in that respect. 
 Then on top of that would be about $1.9 billion of money that would be devoted to completing the existing share repurchase authorization. And there is (indiscernible) 2.3 billion which was cash as of September 30. And so what's this above all of that then obviously is available for growth or available for shareholder distribution. On the first piece [ph] of growth what I want to say is if we encounter M&amp;A activity or if we encounter potential project activity which gives compelling returns on a risk adjusted basis and businesses in our strategic stairway North American buyers, you should assume that we will look at those things and we will consider them. 
 Having said that though there is nothing out there right now for which I have a lot of visibility in front of me specific to talk about on the [ph] visibility very much. Beyond that obviously there is a significant amount of additional cash flow available for distribution to shareholders. So absent compelling projects or absent compelling M&amp;A opportunities, all of that shaded blue area would be available for additional shareholder distribution. And the form of those would be something I think we'll talk about it later point in time, but in some form or fashion additional shareholder distribution. 
 Just on how we're thinking about the sources and uses of our funding over the next three years and just beyond that as well, I want to spend a little bit of time – you all have seen these slides on the project because I think it's important that one of the consistent pieces I got from a number of investors is I think that we ought to be a bit more transparent about what the returns profile of the project actually are and so we're going to do that here. So I want to really make three points clear about our project. 
 If you look at the photograph on this slide, the first point will be very clear and that is these projects are projects that are in flight. They are not things that we're contemplating doing. These are things that we are in fact doing. We have a contract in place with USDA [ph] for engineering and procurement, we are procuring equipment and designing and engineering activity today. In addition, as we can see from the picture in detail and also Port Neal, we are in the process of moving dirt and driving piles and making these projects happen as we speak and we're projecting those things. Those projects we believe will come in on time and on budget. At this point which I'll remind you the budget was $3.8 billion plus or minus 10% on either side where we expect those coming on time, on budget. 
 Then really turning to the thing I think most and what we've done here just as an aside really we estimate that operatively [ph] so people have to update their knowledge because what we've not done is (indiscernible) profile. It looks like over the next three years, we'd expect for the project and so that will give you some view on that along the milestones in each of those years. 
 But more importantly on the right you see the chart that shows across the X-axis urea prices and that's urea U.S. Gulf prices though not necessary our realized prices in market, but those are urea U.S. Gulf prices because that's the language everybody can understand. And then down the other side is natural gas prices at Henry Hub again not necessary reflective of our gas prices at the location because of our basis differential. 
 But what we see is that if we look at an environment like we experienced in third quarter from a $300 roughly urea price per short term U.S. Gulf and you combine that with a gas price that is very significantly higher than the gas prices that we see today and have seen for a while and we would call $5 at the top of our planning range for gas being $5, what you see if we've got a 14% IRR. And obviously as you walk up the urea price or you walk down the gas price, the trends become ever more compelling. 
 So these are good projects. They make sense for us to be doing them. We are in this business. This is in our sweet spot. They have robust returns well in excess of our profit capital and we believe over time as we execute our share repurchase program and we complete these projects, we will be making each shareholder's shares more valuable because what's happening is we will be using both of those initiatives, we will be increasing quite significantly the number of nitrogen nutrients for 1,000 shares, so the exposure the shareholder will have to the underlying business will continue to grow and that I think has been and will continue to be quite a compelling story. 
 Really I think we've sort of made these points I think CF is a compelling investment. I think our investment thesis is good, our strategic focus is clear if understood. I think today and what we've done is we've gone a long way in making it clear to people what our capital sources priorities are, what our capital uses priorities are. And I think really it's just a fantastic story. I will say that people will look at this I think today and say, well, gosh, this looks like a lot of new thinking and actually it really does and it reflects I think a bit more granularity in detail into our thinking, but the things that we're talking about here in the presentation I made are things that the company and the management team talked about all the time and it's really trying to give you all some insight as to sort of what that hope [ph] does. 
 So with that and I don't know how much time we've got left, P. J. Let's open up the floor to some questions and I'll invite my colleagues to join me. Thanks. 
 "
MON," 
   Monsanto Company (MON) Citi Basic Materials Conference December  4, 2013  3:10 PM ET 
 Robb Fraley 
 Let me get started and thanks. P.J., it's always a pleasure to be here and you have got a lot of exciting things going on in the meeting and it's great to be part of it. I am going to jump right into the technology story on Monsanto and that's basically geared on how we increase yield and productivity and what I want to emphasize today is a lot of the growth platforms, some of the new technologies, some of the new global opportunities we see for growth and basically point that all of the innovations that I think are going to drive our lead and as a technology company and with more commercial product to our pipeline, so as always from an R&amp;D perspective I am going to be forward-looking and you all know what that mean. 
 Let me jump right into a key premise, which I always like to start with, because it's really been the premise of the company from the beginning for our business and I think it's really the premise for most of you as investors or owners and that's the investment case for agriculture. 
 I think it's important to do this. There has been a lot of questions we've gotten over the last few months on commodity prices and we talked a lot about that today and there has been changes in Brazil plantings and in Chinese import and in ethanol, so I'll talk about all of those in either questions or later on in the presentation, I will talk about what does this $4 corn mean for the industry or not. 
 I think, I would like to just start with the long-term view, because if you take a look at corn for example, 35 billion bushels of corn produced around the world. Over the period of the last 8 or 10 years, we have added about 900 million bushels per year. As we model going forward, we see that maybe being a bit more conservative in the future in the $500 million to $600 million bushel range, but still a lot of growth. 
 Importantly, in the past few years most of that has come from [expansion], what we see in the future is a lot of that will come from yield increase. Similarly on the soybean front, you can see the projections and clearly the point here is demand is alive and well for the major corn and soybean crops. As I said, a lot of that yield in the future is going to come from higher productivity and a lot of that will come from the global market. We have seen corn expansion clearly in South America, Europe, Eastern Europe and Asia. Soybean is clearly a technology where 90% of the production is in the U.S. 
 Let me move forward with a little bit of long-term view on the pipeline, make a couple of quick points there and how we are using technologies to meet this global demand. First point, I just summarize and say, the pipeline is increasing. We have added about 70 new products in the pipeline, cutting across biotech, seed grades, information technology platforms, overall value of our pipeline has actually increased over the last several years. We see it valued at about $25 billion in peak sales going forward, so that's my R&amp;D [bids] that there is a lot more to come. 
 Second, I would argue that based on the broad set of technologies and products that are competitive advantage both, on breeding side, on the trait side and I think on the information technology side has broadened and we are well-positioned with our pipeline to drive future yield and productivity. The last point is that, at a high level, most of the advances that have fueled the growth of the company have been basically advances in biology whether it’s the use of markers and sequencing to drive breeding and productivity or biotechnology traits that has driven performance. 
 What we are seeing now is the other wave of innovations from information technology and data management and we've moved aggressively in this space and I think the sweet spot is really being there we see the advances in biology and information technology coming together on the farm. 
 I always like to start especially this time of the year with what's going on with yield, so just to put it all in perspective, at this point in time almost all the corn and soybean in U.S. has been harvested. At our November Investor Day, we talked about where yields were. We had about 40% of the data in. Now we've got about 80% of the data in and I'll do a little bit of updating. What you see here is, in the kind of the orange bar is, our overall yield corn performance, and all of those other bars will be the history of the last several years. 
 First thing you notice is this is probably the best all-time yields we have seen for our DEKALB product. It's also going to be a record year I think for the U.S. corn industry. The other important thing is, when you compare the orange bar to the yellow bar, we have measured now our yield advantage over the competitive corn hybrids to be about eight bushels, so that's an uptick from where we were in the November and that reflects the fact that as harvest is completed, our high performance in that Northern cornbelt has bought our yield advantage up and so that's exciting news. 
 I think the importance from a grower perspective is, we about being in a band of about a 7 to 10-bushel yield advantage over the last 10 years, so last year in an all time drought in whether impacted year. We had a yield advantage. This year, basically when everybody had strong performance, we still enjoyed a yield advantage and it's that consistency of yield performance that has largely defined our brands and our pricing advantage in the marketplace and of course that performance is associated with volume growth and share gains for the DEKALB brand and I'll talk a little bit more in a minute, but it is still a bit early for us, but at this stage the corn order book looks very strong, reflective of this type of our performance. 
 Just briefly, I know there's a lot of focus on the U.S., particularly at this time of year, so I would just like to highlight that we run a global breeding program, and to achieve that 35 billion bushels of corn that's produced every year requires input from corn production in many, many world areas and Sam Eathington in the back here, runs our global breeding program. I'll ask Sam to stand up for a second. He is in charge of all of our corn, soybean and cotton breeding and it's great to have him here. 
 Every year, we put out breeding trials around the world. I always like to drop a little factoid, but if you take all of our breeding trials, all those rows of crops and you staff (Inaudible) and they go around New York more than twice, so it's a giant breeding engine and we didn't screen the varieties in hybrids from that we then used to at the launch in the global marketplace and so we are driving the U.S. market, Latin America, Central America and increasingly strong positions in Europe, Eastern Europe, particularly Ukraine and in obviously Brazil and Argentina, strong positions where we have a similar 7 to 10 bushel yield advantage. 
 In China, we will continue our progress in our joint venture with Sinochem, so we are in a very strong position to leverage the global growth in corn to meet the seed food and fuel the opportunities. 
 On the other soybean front, also been a very strong year. You can see the dark green bar, that's the performance of our Roundup Ready 2 Yield genetic versus the light green bar which is competitive genetic. Similar story to corn, overall yields were the highest we've seen in a long time and our yield differential is about four bushels in soybean and that reflects I think the fairly established strong performance of the Roundup Ready 2 Yield platform. As you know, that's been a mainstay of our transition from Roundup Ready 1 to the Roundup Ready 2 Yield. 
 We have the moved that through our won Asgrow germplasm as well as licensed that to most of the other soybean players and as maybe you know we have completed that similar licensing arrangement most recently with DEKALB. From an Asgrow perspective, we grew significant the soybean share and also the order book at this stage is very strong, so we are well positioned in the Americas for a soybean growth. 
 Let me talk a little bit about how that performance leadership in the breeding in germplasm translates into an overall commercial opportunity. The first point that I always like to talk about and I'll take a couple of different (Inaudible). I think that our investment in breeding and the annual upgrade that that gives us in our germplasm performance, and the ability to replace about 20% of our corn and soybean portfolio products every year with a higher yielding set of products gives us that the that margin lift, so don't Sam's team is charged with introducing commercially about 200 new corn hybrids that populate that global corn map for us and the lets us enjoy that 5% to 10% price lift across our overall our portfolio and that has been a key driver for the business in all the world areas. 
 That kind of leads directly into the right-hand side, which is how does that model work in today's pricing environment, because you can see the corn commodity prices, I think if you look on your phone today and you look at what the price projection is for December 14 corn, $4.65, so that's the pricing environment that we are looking into for the crop that will get [printed] the screen and I will just say we feel very, very comfortable about the a performance of our product based on the order book and I think it's important to understand that as we set the pricing for our seed products, we've always price to abandon [corn] $4 to $6 ban. We haven't tried to push the prices at the high point in that cycle, and at the current prices we see no difficulty. The performance has been strong, the order book is strong and in many ways as we were talking in the one-on-ones this morning and this afternoon, as prices come down it magnifies the importance for the grower of yield, so we are seeing these have low prices low yield and beast position is having strong yields. 
 As the growers making no stack of trade-off decisions, the last thing they give up on is the opportunity for a high-yielding crop, so we are very comfortable with the performance band we are in and if there is any other questions, we can deal with that maybe in the Q&amp;A. 
 A couple of areas I just wanted to highlight for a particular market expansion opportunity, one relates to a northern corn and it's directly an outcome of quality, we have seen that band for corn production move northward around the world. Corn growing opportunities now in Dakotas, in Canada and in Ukraine and the Soviet Union, so we have targeted specific breeding programs and locations for corn production above the 49th parallel around the world. It also fits in very well with our business strength. They have very, very strong genetic to form in Dakota, Minnesota geographies and those are directly a transportable into Ukraine, Soviet Union. 
 What's going on economically here, if you look back and I think the Dakotas is a great example. If you go to South Dakota and North Dakota and look back 20 years ago, they didn't grow corn, it was all wheat. The corn yields and the benefit of the traits have increased so dramatically that the economics drive corn substitution in those markets, and so farmers make more money planning corn than they do barley or wheat or some of the other alternatives. 
 Last year was kind of an important pivot point. It was the first time in North and South Dakota, where actually the number of corn acres exceeded the number of wheat acres. That same phenomena is going to happen in Canada and across the Ukraine and Soviet Union, where the economics drive growing corn as their source of seed, fuel and food and their ability to shift will drive the opportunity, so we are investing heavily in new breeding locations, building seed production and manufacturing plants in the Ukraine and we see that opportunity as a significant the acreage and growth driver for the company. 
 Just kind of walking around the world in corn in terms of technology upgrades and advancement, I'll start here and in the U.S. it's the portfolio upgrade that I have talked about. It's driving the full penetration of the SmartStax and DroughtGard launching the first the FieldScripts and in position ourselves for the replacement products to SmartStax, which will enter the marketplace at the end of the decade and continue to drive that [family]. 
 In Brazil, they are moving quickly to hybrid corn. We have seen trait adoption. They are transitioning largely now to the double-stack corn, so we penetrated this year about half the market. We have an opportunity there and then we will see the upgrade tripled in South America. They have gone through the double-cycle. They are moving to triples and we are seeing margin expansion and opportunity there, and in other parts of the world, we are getting our regulatory approvals for the other biotech crops. 
 Again, important part when you look about our growth engine, it's the upgrades in germplasm, it's the acreage growth and then the tremendous margin leverage as we step up to technology adaption with higher profit margin, multiple trait component packages from the corn front. 
 Looking at it from a soybean perspective, you can see the planted acres. It's the Americas story and opportunity, and in many ways the next decade or so, we will see a tremendous amount of growth within the company. We have kind of look at the next 10 years, the decade of the being because we are seeing the opportunity in the U.S. to complete the transition to Roundup Ready 2 Yield, the of the launch of the Roundup Ready expands the dicamba based product and in South America with the launch of Intacta this year in Brazil and the follow-up in Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, we see significant expansion in margin growth opportunities and we will see future ways with next generation Intacta will involve the multiple bug control and herbicide tolerance trait, so we are only about 20% of the way through the margin opportunity that soybean represents for us as a company. 
 As I indicated the driver for this is the Intacta products. Intacta was just launched this year, so just to make sure we are on the same page, Intacta is the combined double-trait of the Roundup Ready 2 Yield product that's been so successful here in the U.S., plus the addition of a caterpillar trait to help farmers protect their soybeans from caterpillar insect. 
 The light green bar shows the launch we have had this year in Brazil 3 million acres. I would put that in perspective to $1.5 million acre launch we had in the U.S. the 3 million acre launch is the largest soybean launch we have ever had anywhere in the world and the Brazilian market. The feedback has been very, very strong on the product. We are providing both, the benefit of incremental yield that we see with the Roundup Ready 2 Yield products, plus the reduction of sprays and higher yields as a result of better insect control, so great launch and we are now focused on providing more and more varieties to expand the ability to penetrate the 100 million acre opportunity that's achievable with this technology. 
 On an incidental note, you might have been getting feedback or hearing about some of the insect outbreaks with the earworm in Brazil. We are seeing a lot of our report on strong performance of Intacta versus the earworm. I think having been with the company for a long time and launch product under conditions where we've had low level insect pressure high level insect pressure. This is a great thing that will clearly differentiate the strong performance of the product and I think that will add to the already high level of enthusiasm for the product in the marketplace. 
 The last piece I would focus on in-depth and emphasize that Intacta has a long cycle in terms of its acre penetration. Our focus from a research perspective is already on the second and third generation products, so we will be bringing next-generation caterpillar control, multiple genes, modes of action, combined together that will provide even more durable insect protection as well as bringing the Roundup Ready Xtend that [right] into this market, so we've got a built-in set of next-generation multiple bug and weeds control product targeted for the South America opportunity. 
 Coming back to the U.S. and pending a bit more time on the Roundup Ready Xtend system, we are really excited about the progress here. This was our year of groundbreakers in the U.S. We had trials out with the product. Just, again, the background, this represents the combination now of Roundup Ready 2 Yield with the dicamba resistance trait to combination we call Roundup Ready Xtend, so what this provides is growers the opportunity for that second mode of action to be applied over the top of the crop that helps control either weeds that are resistant to Roundup are just difficult to control broadleaf weeds and I've had an opportunity through growing season, the summer to visit many, many, many sites and I can tell you that the product performs absolutely spectacularly. We have had tremendous feedback from the growers. You can see that big red bar. That's basically feedback from the growers that say this product gives us a much broader spectrum of control and that's what it's all about and it's been very, very positive. 
 The other announcement that we made in our November Investor Meeting, is that we've had really a nice technical breakthrough on the chemical side of this product and that has been the ability to formulate by dicamba with additives in conditions that dramatically reduce what has been a historical propensity of some of the formulation to volatile. 
 You can see the big green bar. That's the old first-generation Banville-type formulation. Those were the first type of dicamba product in the marketplace. Today's clarity formulations are clearly much better, but that little green bar on the right contains our XtendiMax, VaporGrip technology that basically reduces the volatility to zero and that's going to be the kind of product that we launch and I will give the growers the comfort that this product to be used effectively and safely. It's also going to be a tremendous economically beneficial product in terms of low-cost weed control, so there is a huge amount of enthusiasm for the product. 
 As you know, we are in the process of completing the environmental impact statement with the government. We hope we will be in a position to launch this product in 2015. From a breeding program perspective, we have already converted our soybean breeding program developing the stack product and will be in a position to launch a very large product launch that has soybean varieties basically adapted from the Northern U.S. to the South and that's exciting. We are also moving forward internationally with this product. We already have many of the key approvals in South America and in Canada and we are moving aggressively to launch in international markets as well. 
 Let me just move to a couple of new platforms. I'll talk a little bit about the precision Ag and some of the other areas, and as you know this was our test market year for our own FieldScripts program, which is our a genetic based program where we recommend to growers specific hybrids and create a script in terms of being able to vary the planting density to optimize yield. As you know, we have mapped a lot of the corn fields into 10 meter by 10 meter grid. Look at the yield zone and instead of planning that uniform level of corn across the entire field, we created the algorithms based on the knowledge of the genetic and the topography of the field to vary their population, so the growers have the ability to optimize yields. We've historically seen a 5% yield advantage through that precision agriculture approach. This year on 40,000 acres with the other FieldScript that have all of our high resolution data maps included. We continue to see about a 5% bushel of yield advantage. We will be launching this spring in the United States. We've announced a $10 price per acre for this fee in mapping service and we are excited and as I will talk about a minute I think there is a lot of opportunity in precision ag as we bring together the advances in biology and information technology. 
 The way I think about it is, these are two separate platforms, so our FieldScript platform is targeted based on the generic knowledge fits our seed footprints and I've already talked about the first FieldScript, which is variable rate population for corn planting. Second scripts will include variable rate nutrition, because once you vary the population of that corn plant in the field, you need to see it differently, you need to manage the disease differently in those become next-generation apps for FieldScripts. 
 With the acquisition of the Climate Pro just a few weeks ago, we have exciting opportunity to expand that footprint. If you look at the climate.com and the Climate Pro, basically this is an information dashboard for the farmer based on really believable weather modeling in terms of historical weather impacts on yield and the ability to basically step through the growers set the decision and optimize each of that decision through historical data management and real-time weather prediction and so the opportunity for this technology platform is to add value not only to the our own genetics platform with FieldScripts, but to be able to add value to other acres and other crops, so it will be an opportunity to move forward. 
 Nice, complimentary approach between the two platforms, the precision planting approach that we've used through FieldScripts has been largely weather neutral bringing out whether component on hybrid performance will make it even better and make our hybrid selections better. The historical climate approach has assumed generic genetic, so by bringing specific knowledge on soybean variety and hybrid performance will improve their modeling, but I think it's an exciting first step. 
 I can tell you we are working really hard on data transfer, working with customers. Since we did our November Investor Day, we've had lots of interest from potential partners in the in the [chain]. Other input providers, grain handlers, equipment companies et cetera, and retailers do we see as the partners to extend and create more value and share their value as we develop the platform. 
 Let me just close and talk a little bit about our some of our other new platforms based on the biologicals and these for us are really two categories. One, are the microbial based product, so microorganisms that we can use, our DNA testing and our field testing capability to select better microbes, the seed treatments. The other is our technology around BioDirect, where you know that we've made advancements and being able to use the RNAi technology to deliver to plants and pest and use that to provide a temporary biological effect for pest control, weed control than what is very exciting. 
 These are both, biologically based, they are driven off of our knowledge of gene and genomics, but they allow us to penetrate new markets. These are markets where GMO crops aren't used today where the crops are too small and wouldn't sustain a biotech investment or where a topical application could be a beneficial and so we are excited. That overall biologicals industry market segment is about $2.3 billion. It's growing for a lot of the reasons that you know about in terms of pressure on chemistries are opportunity to create our market penetration with new crop. 
 Since we first started talking about this, we have made a number of acquisitions of companies involved in the RNAi space as well as in the microbial space and this continues to be an area where we look at for future investment and acquisition or partnering opportunities, but the key here is that these are non-transgenic. They provide non-GMO solutions that's still draw on and leverage our database and genomics and DNA capability, so I think it's a nice compliment to both, our breeding and our biotechnology approaches. 
 I'll just closing and talk a little bit about the overall R&amp;D program and put a couple of perspectives on here. First of all, we continue to invest heavily in our RD pipeline, but we have stayed within that bracket of about 10% of sales. The panel on the left shows that we are about a $1.5 billion level investments this year, the light green bars are returns from our seeds and traits business from a gross profit, so R&amp;D spend has increased. It's about a 9% CAGR return on that R&amp;D investment from sale and growth perspective has been about double that rate, and I think that's a nice investment. 
 On the right-hand side, I'd just emphasize, we have got about 70 products in our portfolio. Every year, we go through a deep analysis on our portfolio review looking at the technical risk as well as the market value and we have a number of very significant products that meets our financial hurdle and target 100 million-acre opportunities and those are our great returns I think for the R&amp;D investment. 
 I am going to wrap up and leave you with three takeaways. First, that our pipeline is in a very strong position, plus the pipeline is the key. It's really the heart and soul of Monsanto as a company and I think with the new R&amp;D platforms, we are expanding that. I think from a competitive perspective, I have shared with you a couple of key blockbusters that we just launched, double that are in the pipeline as well as continuing very, very strong breeding performance and performance in both, our corn and soy germplasm. Then lastly, I think, we are very well positioned to take advantage of the continued advances that are driven by the revolution in biology along with the opportunity to match that to information technology and data management and really be able to understand the precisely the performance of the genetics with exactly the characteristics of a field that are mapped now on 10 grid and some exciting interactions of technologies that I think will be game changing for the industry. 
 Thanks. With that we'll open up for few questions. Appreciate it.

Additional information concerning these measures, including reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, is contained in the financial presentation and release relating to this call, both of which are posted on the company's website at www.kornferry.com. 
 With that, I'll turn the call over to Mr. Burnison. Please go ahead, Mr. Burnison. 
 Gary D. Burnison 
 Well, hello, everybody. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. I got to tell you that I'm very proud of our company and our 3,600 employees around the world. 
 We just completed the strongest top line results in the company's history. We had revenue of about $238 million. That was up about 23% over last year on a constant currency basis and a 4% increase sequentially. So our business on an annualized basis based just off the second quarter is doing about $952 million of revenue and throwing off EBITDA on an adjusted basis of almost $150 million. 
 Our adjusted EBITDA margin was approximately 15.5%. That compares to about 12.5% a year ago and 14% in the prior quarter. Adjusted EPS was $0.41, and that's up 24% sequentially and 64% year-over-year. 
 As calendar 2013 comes to a close, the narrative on the economic climate really hasn't changed dramatically. We're in the throes of a new era. One that I've frequently referenced as an unprecedented fight for growth. 
 And speaking with corporate leaders, it's a consensus that the problem of growth, or the lack of it, is rapidly becoming the world's #1 problem. Governments and corporations alike are grappling with the growth question, albeit from different perspectives. And that's exactly the environment that is going to create opportunity for Korn/Ferry, as we help clients drive growth by more effectively linking their business and talent strategies. And it all begins with our flagship search business, which was up 11% year-over-year in a constant currency basis, and it was up sequentially as well. 
 This business is -- it's just a fabulous business. We change people's lives. It's a door opener for broader talent management offerings. It gives us license and access within C-suites all over the world, and our overarching goal is to differentiate and drive revenue across our broader talent solutions capabilities. 
 And executive search is the tip of that spear. It gives us that trust. It gives us that permission, allowing us to engage in discussions with clients about other solutions that may be their buying piecemeal from other providers. And what we bring is fabulous professionals, industry-leading professionals, high-caliber client service of global reach, unique IP, all to help clients design, build and attract talents for the purpose of driving superior performance; in other words, to ignite talent. 
 And during this last year, I think the strength and the steadiness of our strategy has really taken hold, not only by the performance of our search business and where that is, but Korn/Ferry overall, including our non-Search business, which now represents about 41% of the top line. So you've got a company, based on the second quarter, that's doing $952 million of revenue and $264 million of that comes from our leadership business and $128 million comes from Futurestep. And so that 41% of the revenue mix is an all-time high. Of course, that was aided by acquisitions. On an EBITDA basis, Futurestep and LTC represented about 36%, 37% of the EBITDA. 
 Our Futurestep business grew 8% on a constant currency basis. That was driven by the strength of the RPO business. And our leadership offering was $66 million in the quarter. Again, if you just were to annualize that mathematically, that's $264 million. That's up 10% sequentially with a 15.5% adjusted EBITDA margin. 
 And much of that success, I got to tell you, can be attributed to the acquisitions that we've done, Global Novations, a little over a year ago. It's been a game changer for us, as well as PDI, which took place almost exactly 1 year ago. And since that time, we have integrated those firms. We've established new go-to-market protocols. We've successfully onboarded 600 new colleagues, 20% of the company. We've accelerated our delivery process. We've integrated world-class IT, and we've reconciled the offerings that we have. 
 In the year ahead, we're going to remain committed to anchoring our company and knowledge and data using IP as a differentiator throughout all of our business, cascading innovation to our clients. And we believe offerings that are going to enhance our competitive edge in the marketplace. 
 And so I'm certainly very, very proud and pleased. I'm proud of our employees, our colleagues around the world, I can't say that enough, and the accomplishments we've made throughout this calendar year. I'm even more excited about what the future holds for Korn/Ferry. 
 So with that, I've got Gregg Kvochak is here; and Bob Rozek, our Chief Financial Officer. 
 So Bob, I'll turn it over to you. 
 Robert P. Rozek 
 Great. Thanks, Gary, and good afternoon, everyone. As a global labor market gradually recovers and we continue to make progress, bringing our comprehensive suite of talent management solutions to a broader number of clients, Korn/Ferry continues to be positioned as a leader in defining the talent management solution space. As Gary mentioned, we are extremely proud of our second quarter fiscal '14. 
 Despite our normal late summer seasonality, we achieved record-high fee revenues in earnings. On constant currency, our consolidated fee revenue in the quarter grew $44 million or 23% year-over-year to the all-time high of $238 million with growth across all of our major operating segments. Also measured on a constant currency basis, fee revenue improved $9 million or 4% sequentially, again, with upgrowth in all service lines. 
 Additionally, on an organic basis, excluding the revenue from the acquisitions that Gary just mentioned, our consolidated fee revenue was up 8% year-over-year at constant currency. And as also, as Gary mentioned, very pleased that 41% of those revenues come from services outside of search. And then our overall growth continues to outpace many of our major industry competitors. 
 Executive search's new business awards were pretty choppy in the second quarter. Confirmations were sequentially down in the months of August and September, but they really surged back to a 15-month high in October. Our new business confirmations in the second quarter were essentially flat compared to the first quarter of fiscal '14. And our overall new business is up nearly 12% when compared to the second quarter of fiscal '13. 
 In LTC, new business awards continue to gain momentum through the quarter with total second quarter new business up approximately 13% compared to the first quarter. 
 And in Futurestep, our backlog grew sharply in the second quarter as they secured a record number of large, multiyear, multimillion dollar RPO assignments in North America, Europe and Asia Pac. When you combine these assignments, on an annual basis, the recruiting level will be over 9,000 professionals across the globe for the next 3-plus years. 
 Our profitability also continues to improve in the second quarter. Excluding restructuring, integration and separation charges in the current and prior periods, our adjusted EBITDA improved both sequentially and year-over-year, growing $4.8 million or 15%, sequentially, and $12.2 million or 50% year-over-year, reaching a record $36.7 million in the second quarter. 
 Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 15.4% in the second quarter compared to 14% in the first quarter and 12.5% in the second quarter of last year. By segment, our sequential profitability improvement was mixed. In executive search, our adjusted EBITDA margin fell 140 basis points, due primarily to the increase in the second quarter in our variable incentive compensation cost, as well as market-driven investment gains associated with our deferred comp plan that result in increased compensation expense. 
 In L&amp;TC, our adjusted EBITDA margin improved 150 basis points sequentially, driven by higher fee revenue across the more efficient and stable post acquisition cost base. 
 In our Futurestep, our adjusted EBITDA margin fell 540 basis points sequentially and 280 basis points year-over-year, due primarily to the recognition in the quarter of start-up costs associated with the larger RPO wins that I've previously described. 
 And I know the RPO engagements, the revenue would be recognized in future periods as the contract milestones are completed. But we're obviously are incurring some start-up costs in the current quarters as we ramp those up. Over time, when we get to a full ramp-up on those contracts, we expect Futurestep's EBITDA margins to return to the more normalized level in the 12% to 14% range. 
 On a GAAP basis, including all restructuring, integration and separation charges, fiscal '14 second quarter operating earnings were $23.2 million with a 9.7% margin compared to $16.6 million and a 7.3% margin in the first quarter of fiscal '14 and $2.8 million and a 1.4% margin in the second quarter of fiscal '13. 
 In the second quarter, we also incurred $2 million of additional management separation charges. Our financial position also continue to improve in the second quarter with ending total cash and marketable securities of $315 million, up $35 million compared to the first quarter of fiscal '14 and down $17 million compared to the second quarter of fiscal '13. Excluding cash and marketable securities reserved for deferred comp arrangements and for accrued bonuses, our current investable cash balance is approximately $127 million, down $6 million versus the first quarter with about 22% of net cash residing in the U.S. 
 Finally, excluding all restructuring integration and separation charges in the current and prior quarters, second quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share were a record $0.41, an improvement of $0.08 or 24% sequentially, and $0.16 or 64% year-over-year. 
 On a GAAP basis, including the impact of all those charges, our fiscal '14 second quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.38 compared to $0.23 in the first quarter of fiscal '14 and $0.03 in the second quarter of fiscal '13. 
 I'll now turn the call over to Gregg to review our operating segments in a little more detail. 
 Gregg Kvochak 
 Thanks, Bob. Let's start with our Executive Recruitment segment. Despite the seasonality of the summer months, global demand for our Executive Recruitment services improved in the second quarter. Consolidated Executive Recruitment fee revenue in the second quarter was $140 million, up $3.3 million or 2.4% sequentially, and up $12.2 million or 9.6% year-over-year. Measured at constant currency, second quarter consolidated Executive Recruiting fee revenue was up 2.3% sequentially and up 10.9% year-over-year. Regionally, also at constant currency, North America was up 1.5%; Asia-Pacific was up 4%; South America was up 31.7%, Europe was seasonally weaker by 3% on a sequential basis. 
 Year-over-year, also on a constant currency basis, North America grew 8.7%; Europe grew 1.2%; Asia-Pacific was up 25.1%; and South America was up 42.1%. Sequential growth in our Executive Recruitment specialty practices was mixed in the second quarter. Worldwide growth was strongest in our life sciences and health care practice, up 10%, and our technology practice, up 11%. While our consumer goods, financial service and industrial practices were down 8%, 3% and 2%, respectively. 
 Financial services accounted for approximately 16.5% of all Executive Recruitment fee revenue in the second quarter, down approximately 100 basis points from the first quarter of fiscal '14. 
 Year-over-year, also at actual rates, all of our specialty practices grew in the second quarter with the exception of the consumer goods practice. Life sciences and health care was up 35%. Technology was up 16%, while financial services and industrial were up 1% each. 
 Worldwide, the consumer goods practice were down 7% year-over-year in the second quarter, driven primarily by softer market conditions in North America and Europe. 
 The total number of dedicated executive recruiting consultants worldwide at the end of the second quarter was 412, up 10, year-over-year, and down 4, sequentially. Annualized fee revenue production per consultant in the second quarter was approximately $1.35 million compared to approximately $1.25 million in the second quarter of fiscal '13 and $1.34 million in the first quarter of fiscal '14. 
 The number of new search assignments opened worldwide in the second quarter was 1,300, which was up 11%, year-over-year, and up 7%, sequentially. Excluding all restructuring charges, consolidated executive search adjusted EBITDA and margin in the second quarter improved $7.4 million or 31.7% year-over-year with a 370-basis-point improvement in margin. This improvement was driven primarily by higher consultant productivity and lower fixed and variable G&amp;A expense. 
 On a sequential basis, consolidated executive search adjusted EBITDA was down $1.2 million or 3.7% due primarily, as Bob mentioned earlier, to slightly higher variable compensation expense and market-driven investment gains associated with the firm's deferred compensation plan that adversely impacted compensation and benefit expense. 
 Executive search consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin was 21.9% in the second quarter of fiscal '14 compared to 23.3% in the first quarter of fiscal '14 and 18.2% in the second quarter of fiscal '13. 
 Now turning to our Leadership &amp; Talent Consulting segment. In the second quarter of fiscal '14, worldwide fee revenue for L&amp;TC improved to a new high of $66 million. Measured on a constant currency basis, L&amp;TC fee revenue grew sequentially, $5.8 million or 9.7%, with strong growth in North America and Asia Pacific, offsetting seasonal weakness in Europe. Year-over-year, on an organic basis, excluding the fee revenue from the recent acquisitions of both Global Novations and PDI Ninth House, L&amp;TC's fee revenue was down $500,000 or 1.5%. Regionally, North America accounted for approximately 71% of the total L&amp;TC worldwide fee revenue in the second quarter compared to 67% in the first quarter of fiscal '14. 
 At the end of the second quarter, there were 129 dedicated L&amp;TC consultants compared to 134 in the first quarter of fiscal '14 and 72 in the second quarter of fiscal '13. Professional staff utilization improved to 70% in the second quarter, up 500 basis points sequentially. Compared to the first quarter of fiscal '14, L&amp;TC's adjusted EBITDA improved $1.8 million or 21.7% to $10.2 million, driven by both higher fee revenue and a stable, more efficient cost post-integration cost base. 
 Adjusted EBITDA margin in the second quarter was 15.5% compared to 14% in the first quarter of fiscal '14 and 20.7% in the second quarter of fiscal '13. 
 Finally, turning to Futurestep, which generated $31.9 million of fee revenue in the second quarter. Measured on a constant currency basis, Futurestep's second quarter fee revenue was up $2.4 million or 7.9% year-over-year and up $200,000 or 60 basis points sequentially. 
 On a regional basis, measured sequentially at constant currency, North America was down 3.1%; Europe was essentially flat; while Asia-Pacific was up 4.9%. As previously mentioned, Futurestep's confirmed backlog search in the second quarter as they were awarded multiple large RPO contracts that will generate fee revenue over the next several years. 
 Futurestep's adjusted EBITDA margin was 9.3% in the second quarter and slipped both sequentially and year-over-year, primarily due to start-up costs incurred in the second quarter associated with the new RPO wins, for the timing of revenue recognition will be deferred to future periods as contract milestones are completed, as Bob previously discussed. 
 Now I'll turn the call back over to Bob to discuss our outlook for the third quarter of fiscal '14. 
 Robert P. Rozek 
 Thanks a lot, Gregg. As we mentioned, our new orders during the quarter were somewhat choppy, given the strength of October, however we enter the third quarter with a solid backlog. Some of the choppiness that we saw in the second quarter, we expect to continue through the year-end holiday months where new orders are not only expected to be seasonally weaker. But consultants also have fewer business days in front of clients to work off confirmed assignments. With the time taken off on the holidays, we expect that there will be somewhere in the range of 6 to 8 less working days in the third quarter versus what we saw in Q2. 
 To start the third quarter, our November new orders were down relative to October but in line with our expectation. Assuming worldwide economic conditions, financial markets and foreign exchange rates remain steady. Fiscal '14 third quarter fee revenue is likely to range from $221 million to $237 million. And diluted earnings per share are likely to range from $0.30 to $0.38 per share. 
 With that, I'll conclude our prepared remarks, and we would be glad to answer any questions you may have.

   Guess? (GES) Q3 2014 Earnings Call December  4, 2013  4:30 PM ET 
 Operator 
 Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Guess? Third Quarter Fiscal 2014 Earnings Conference Call. On the call are Paul Marciano, Chief Executive Officer; Michael Relich, Chief Operating Officer; Sandeep Reddy, Chief Financial Officer; and Russell Bowers, Chief Financial Officer of North America Retail. 
 During today's call, the company will be making forward-looking statements, including comments regarding future plans and financial outlook. The company's actual results may differ materially from current expectations based on risk factors included in the company's quarterly and annual reports filed with the SEC. Please note that this conference is being recorded. 
 Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Paul Marciano. 
 Paul Marciano 
 Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. We are pleased with our third quarter performance, as we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.42, which exceeded the top end of expectation. With the executive management team now fully in place, we made very good progress on many of our strategic initiatives during the quarter. 
 Overall, the third quarter, we saw stabilization of trend in most of our business across the regions. With prudent planning, we were able to anticipate and manage our resource carefully as well as our inventory, finishing the quarter with nearly flat inventory to last year. This is critical considering that we are seeing more aggressive promotional activities globally. 
 In North America, our retail business met expectations with comp sales down 5%. The business performed consistently throughout the third quarter. Mall traffic remained soft in both U.S. and Canada, but we were able to significantly drive up conversion in our own stores with a more compelling collection. 
 In the month of November, trends have improved. We were able to deliver slightly negative comp helped in part by a positive Black Friday weekend. We saw great response to our offering in denims, knit tops and handbags. Traffic trend improved from the third quarter in both U.S. and Canada and conversion continued to trend positively. 
 The product assortment in our stores is beginning to reflect the vision of our design and merchandising team. As we continue to innovate and refine our collection across all categories, I am very encouraged to see that our retail product strategy is improving rapidly. 
 Our omni-channel strategy continued to take shape during the quarter, now with 100 stores participating in -- on in-store fulfillment. 
 Along with some industry-leading technology that we implemented in the past year, we drove a 33% increase in our North American e-commerce business over last year. 
 In Europe, we made progress in our retail business, even as economic condition remained challenging. Our retail stores in almost every country saw the trend improve from the first half, led by Spain, Germany and Portugal, all comped positively. Overall, Europe comp finished down in the low-single digit, consistent with expectation. 
 Our wholesale business, especially Italy, continued to contract during the quarter as we expected. The decline continued to come primarily from our multi-brand customers who are having the most difficulty navigating the challenging political and economic environment in Italy and France. 
 In Asia, our revenue declined by 3% in the quarter, better than what we have planned. Our South Korean business grew modestly, while the Greater China business declined. We continued to see soft consumer spending in mainland China, while our Hong Kong and Macau stores remained strong and delivered positive comp. 
 In closing, we have a strong management team here. We have a clear understanding of the Guess? brand and history of international expansion, as well as a strong balance sheet. It is our job to extend our growth and execute our vision in existing market and deliver strong results. Next quarter will be decisive for the year result and the discipline we apply to deliver high-quality products to our consumer for this holiday. 
 With that, I will hand over to Sandeep to discuss the financial performance of the third quarter. 
 Sandeep Reddy 
 Thank you, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. During this conference call, all of our analysis will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of restructuring charges incurred during the first 3 quarters of fiscal 2014. You can find more details on these charges and reconciliation to our GAAP results in today's earnings release. 
 Moving on to the results. Third quarter net earnings decreased 3% to $35 million, and diluted earnings per share was $0.42, down 2% compared to $0.43 per share in last year's third quarter. 
 Third quarter revenues decreased 2% to $613 million in U.S. dollars and declined 4% in constant currency. 
 Total company gross profit for the third quarter was $228 million, down 8%, and gross margin was 220 basis points lower at 37.2%. Occupancy deleverage in Europe and more promotions in North America were the main drivers of the margin change. 
 We leveraged our operating expenses, posting an SG&amp;A rate of 29.1%, an improvement of 110 basis points over last year's third quarter. Overall, SG&amp;A decreased 6% to $178 million. The lower rate was primarily driven by lower selling and merchandising spend in Europe and lower advertising and marketing spend. 
 Operating profit for the third quarter decreased $8 million to $50 million, and operating margin declined by 110 basis points to 8.1%. 
 We recorded restructuring charges of $2 million in the third quarter, primarily related to consolidation and streamlining of our European operations. These charges consisted mainly of lease termination payments related to the exit of certain store locations that no longer align with our strategic priorities and severance expenses. Other net income was $4 million and mostly represents gains from other nonoperating assets. 
 Our effective third quarter GAAP tax rate was 33% compared to 35% in the prior year quarter, in line with our guidance for the quarter and for the year. 
 Now I'll review our segments, starting with North American Retail. 
 In North American Retail, third quarter revenues were down 3% at $254 million, driven by a 5% decline in comp store sales in the U.S. and Canada, partially offset by growth in our e-commerce business. 
 Gross margin declined in the quarter compared to a year ago, primarily due to more promotional activities. 
 SG&amp;A decreased, both in terms of dollar and rate, as a result of lower store expenses, as well as lower advertising and marketing spend. This was partially offset by deleverage due to negative comp store sales. 
 Operating earnings declined $3 million to $6 million, and operating margin decreased 100 basis points to 2.4%. 
 During the quarter, we opened 3 new stores and closed 8, ending the period with 502 stores in the U.S. and Canada. 
 In Europe, third quarter revenues were $201 million, representing a 1% decrease in U.S. dollars and a 7% decline in local currency. 
 Wholesale shipments continued to decline in Southern Europe, partially offset by growth in newer markets. 
 In our Europe retail business, comp store sales declined in the low-single digits but were more than offset by new store expansion and favorable currency translation. 
 Gross margin declined compared to last year, mainly due to a higher occupancy rate driven by lower wholesale shipments and retail expansion. SG&amp;A expenses declined significantly, both in terms of dollar and rate, primarily due to lower selling and merchandising costs. 
 Operating earnings decreased by $1 million to $14 million, and operating margin decreased 50 basis points to 6.7%. 
 In Asia, revenues in the third quarter declined by 3% to $73 million in U.S. dollars and 6% in constant currency. In Korea, the top line increased in the low-single digits in local currency and mid-single digits in U.S. dollars, driven by store expansion as well as slightly positive comp store sales. This was more than offset by the performance in the rest of Asia, especially in Greater China where revenues were down, mainly driven by lower shipments to our licensee partners, partially offset by positive comps. 
 Operating earnings decreased 24% to $6 million, and operating margin decreased 230 basis points to 8.1%, mainly driven by lower gross margin. 
 In North American Wholesale, third quarter revenues declined 7% to $54 million. Operating earnings decreased by 19% to $12 million, and operating margin decreased 310 basis points to 22.6%. The lower operating margin is primarily driven by a higher SG&amp;A rate compared to last year's and mainly due to deleverage. 
 Royalties generated from sales by our licensee partners were up 3% compared to last year's third quarter at $32 million but below our expectations. Operating earnings increased 8% to $29 million. 
 Now turning our attention to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $360 million compared to $295 million a year ago. This comparison includes the impact of $22 million of repurchases of our stock in the first quarter of this year and a special dividend of $102 million in the fourth quarter of last year. 
 Accounts receivable was 20% lower at $259 million, and overall DSOs improved slightly compared to last year. European DSOs were flat to last year as slower payments in Italy were offset by other regions. 
 Inventories increased just 1% to $427 million as we continue to improve our inventory positions quarter-over-quarter. 
 Lastly, in the third quarter, capital expenditures totaled $15 million. For the full year, we plan to invest between $70 million and $80 million of capital, net of tenant [ph] allowances, primarily for new stores and remodels. 
 With that, I will turn the call over to Mike. 
 Michael Relich 
 Thank you, Sandeep, and good afternoon. Today, I will update you on our business trends and provide our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year 2014. 
 Our overall earnings expectations for the year have not changed. However, we are adjusting our revenue expectations, given the improved visibility in our businesses. 
 In North American Retail, comp store sales were down slightly in the month of November, and we are planning the fourth quarter assuming comp decline in the low-single digits. This, combined with the impact of last year's extra week, would translate into a revenue decline in the low- to mid-single digits. 
 For the full year, we now expect comp store sales to decrease in the mid-single digits and for revenues to decrease in the low-single digits. 
 In Europe, so far in the fourth quarter, comp store sales are consistent with the third quarter and are down in the low-single digits. For the full fourth quarter, we expect the comps to decline in the low- to mid-single digits. 
 For the year, we continue to plan comp store sales to decrease in the mid-single digits. 
 In our Europe Wholesale business, we have completed our sales order campaign for our Spring/Summer collection, which will ship in the fourth quarter as well as the first quarter of next year. The orders, down in the mid-teens, are not as strong as we had anticipated. 
 Considering these factors, as well as the larger store base and the impact of last year's extra week, we expect total Europe fourth quarter revenues to decline in the high-single to low-double digits in local currency. Assuming the euro remains at current rates, this would result in a revenue decline in the mid- to high-single digits in U.S. dollars. 
 For the full year, we expect revenues to decline in the high-single digits in local currency and mid-single digits in U.S. dollars. 
 In Asia, our business performed in line with expectations in the third quarter, and our outlook for the year has not changed. We are planning for Korea to continue its revenue growth in the fourth quarter. The growth there will be offset by a decline in Greater China as we see a persistent softness in consumer demand and as we work through the impact from the steps we took to stabilize the business of our licensee partners in the last quarter. 
 Given these factors, as well as the impact of last year's 53rd week, we expect fourth quarter revenues for Asia to decline in the mid- to high-single digits. 
 For the full year, we continue to expect revenues to decline in the low-single digits. 
 In our North American Wholesale business, we expect revenues to decrease in the low 20s for the fourth quarter, driven by lower orders for our customers, as well as the anniversary of last year's 53rd week. This will result in a decline in the mid-single digits for the full year. 
 In Licensing, our licensee partners are facing a softer environment than they had expected. As a result, we are planning royalties to be down in the high-single digits in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we now expect royalties to be flat. 
 Turning to gross margin for the fourth quarter, we expect consolidated product margin to decline, mainly as a result of continued promotional activity in North America. 
 We are also planning for a higher occupancy rate, primarily as a result of lower wholesale shipments in Europe and last year's 53rd week. This would translate into a decline in gross margin for the full year. 
 With respect to operating expenses, we expect a flat to slightly down SG&amp;A rate for the fourth quarter. For the full year, we expect the SG&amp;A rate to be slightly lower. 
 With respect to taxes and currencies, we are planning the full year with a 33% tax rate and our guidance assumes foreign currencies remain at prevailing rates. 
 Considering all these factors for the fourth quarter, we expect consolidated revenues in the range of $750 million to $770 million. We are planning an operating margin between 13% and 14.5% and for EPS in the range of $0.74 to $0.84 per share, excluding any restructuring charges. 
 These expectations would result in full-year consolidated revenues between $2.55 billion and $2.57 billion, adjusted operating margin between 9% and 9.5% and adjusted EPS in the range of $1.82 to $1.92 per share, excluding any restructuring charges. Including the $0.09 of restructuring charges incurred in the first 9 months of the year, we expect GAAP operating margins between 8.5% and 9% and GAAP EPS in the range of $1.73 to $1.83 per share. 
 With that, I will conclude the company's remarks and open the call up for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator?

   Wet Seal (WTSL) Q3 2013 Earnings Call December  4, 2013  5:00 PM ET 
 Operator 
 Greetings, and welcome to the Wet Seal, Inc. Third Quarter Fiscal 2013 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Christine Greany of The Blueshirt Group. Thank you. Ms. Greany, you may begin. 
 Christine Greany 
 Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Presenting on today's call will be John Goodman, Chief Executive Officer; and Steve Benrubi, Chief Financial Officer. 
 Before we begin, I would like to remind you that today's call may contain forward-looking statements. Information and factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements, as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures, are included in today's press release, as well as our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. These documents are available on our corporate website, wetsealinc.com. The company assumes no obligation to publicly update or revise our forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. 
 With that, I would like to turn the call over to John to begin. John? 
 John D. Goodman 
 Thanks, Christine, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter earnings call. I'll begin with an overview of our third quarter performance and operating highlights, and we'll then discuss our position for holiday. Following my remarks, Steve will provide a detailed review of our third quarter financial results and fourth quarter outlook. 
 Although our third quarter results did not meet the forecast we laid out in August, we were able to achieve slightly positive comp store sales and generate 350 basis points of improvement in merchandise margins. This is especially notable against the backdrop of a very tough retail climate in September and October, when mall traffic declined precipitously. 
 During the quarter, we exercised strict expense control and inventory management. These are 2 of our core operating tenets, which have become increasingly important in today's soft sales environment. 
 Our third quarter SG&amp;A rate declined 250 basis points versus a year ago, and inventories were down at both Wet Seal and Arden B, enabling us to enter the holiday season with appropriate inventory levels. As part of our efforts to remain competitive and drive sales, we stepped up our promotional levels in recent weeks and went deeper on Black Friday. We were managing the business conservatively and operating with lean inventory levels. 
 To that end, we fully intend to move through the product during the holiday season in order to enter January in a clean position. When we see signs of a demand picking up, we are poised to leverage the strong relationships we have with our vendors and quickly chase in the goods as needed. 
 Now I'll turn to product and merchandising. In the third quarter, at Wet Seal, we saw strength in many categories, including accessories, footwear, dresses and sweaters. Our teams have done a good job getting ready for the holiday season. We're putting together appropriate trends, we have the right promotional cadence for the current environment and we're seeing evidence that our marketing programs are starting to break through. Our social media campaigns and partnerships with emerging musical artists are continuing to generate a high level of attention and engagement. 
 Some of our featured celebrities in the fourth quarter will include: Bonnie McKee, Fifth Harmony; Jazz in 5 [ph] and 5 Seconds of Summer. On the digital front, we launched our newly created show, The Intern, on AwesomenessTV, one of the top YouTube channels focused on teens. The Intern provides an inside look at the marketing world at Wet Seal, as 2 young women go head-to-head on the various challenges of working in a retail environment. We're also planning additional product integrations for the AwesomenessTV show, IMO, which has proven to be an effective way for us to reach a highly targeted and relevant customer base. 
 From a mobile perspective, we've really stepped up our game following our e-commerce replatform. Our website now has responsive design, which provides us with the capability to drive additional transactions online using text messaging. Specifically, we've developed new in-store signage, promotions and employee incentives to drive sign-ups. We've also created some innovative programs to help us differentiate the Wet Seal brand. 
 By way of example, during Black Friday weekend, we offered an exclusive doorbuster promotion with ABC family, where all entries were done via mobile. The winner will visit the set of our favorite show, meet the cast, and receive $1,000 gift card. 
 We were pleased with the rollout of the Crush by ABC Family line in late October. This month, we're participating in ABC Family's 25 Days of Giveaways, which offers Wet Seal and Crush merchandise as prizes. We're also working with social media influencers and [indiscernible] to promote the line. We'll begin product tie-ins during the week of January 7 in connection with the season premiere of key shows. 
 Merchandise worn by the characters will be immediately available to our customers both in-store and on the Wet Seal website. As we anticipated, we're finally in collaboration with ABC family to be an effective marketing tool and terrific exposure for our brand. 
 Moving now to e-commerce. Our third quarter sales decline primarily reflects the system limitations we were under prior to implementing a new Demandware platform, as well as the operational focus on ensuring a smooth transition. We successfully launched a new system late October, which has resulted in a marked improvement in functionality. We know it's imperative that we build a more relevant e-commerce presence, and we're now much better positioned to do so. 
 Our core [ph] customer is always on her mobile and expects to have the ability to transact from any device. I am pleased to note that we've seen an increase in the conversion rates since our replatform was completed. 
 Turning to Arden B. In the third quarter, we had strong performance in knit tops, non-denim bottoms and jewelry. The stores are beginning to more fully reflect the influence of Tamara Chamberlain, who joined the company in late spring. We think the new product looks very good, and we're fairly well positioned for holiday. Inventory levels are somewhat light, so we'll be chasing in the goods in the coming weeks. 
 From a marketing perspective, we're employing select digital and social strategies, including special promotions and contests to help drive traffic and sales. 
 Before turning the call over to Steve, I'll update you on our new store openings. Between late October and mid-November, we opened 20 new Wet Seal stores, 19 of those in key outlet centers. Our Wet Seal Plus store, which opened in October at Clovis corner in the California Central Valley, is performing well and we continue to see good response to our Jr. Plus business on our e-commerce site. Looking ahead, we anticipate the company will pursue additional Wet Seal store openings in outlet centers and off-mall locations. 
 There is no question this holiday season will continue to be highly promotional throughout the mall. We're working diligently to manage the factors within our control. While we have guarded expectations, we feel good about our inventory levels at Wet Seal, as well as our merchandising and marketing initiatives and our promotional calendar. Equally important, we're keeping a tight reign on expenses. When I joined the company in January, we put together an ambitious agenda and began executing right out of the gate. We made a great deal of progress quickly and continue to see evidence that our strategies have had a positive impact on the business. 
 As you well know, mall traffic shifted dramatically in September. And since that time, the environment has remained tough. Throughout this year, our team has demonstrated a strong commitment to Wet Seal and worked hard to position the company for consistent, profitable growth over the long term. We're focused on disciplined execution in the current environment and believe the business is positioned to regain momentum when the retail climate improves. 
 Now I'll introduce Steve to review the financials. 
 Steven H. Benrubi 
 Thanks, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Net sales for the third quarter came in at $127.7 million, down 5.8% versus a year ago, including a decrease of $2.8 million, due to the retail calendar shift, while consolidated comparable store sales increased just under 1%. From a regional perspective, we saw relatively stronger performance in the West and Southeast. 
 On a comp store basis, combined average unit retail was up slightly to $9.60. Transactions per store were up 5%, and units per transaction declined 5%. 
 Combined e-commerce sales in the third quarter were down 18.9% versus a year ago, which largely reflects our focus on transition to our new Demandware platform, which went live near the end of the quarter. Despite the decline, we were able to generate an improvement in merchandise margin with a more disciplined approach to promotional pricing. 
 As John noted, the new e-commerce platform has already had a positive impact on conversion rates and puts us on a level-playing field as we compete for her attention and shopping dollars. 
 In the Wet Seal division, third quarter net sales were $114.9 million, down 2.6% versus last year, including a decrease of $2.7 million due to the retail calendar shift, while comparable store sales increased 1.7%. E-commerce sales decreased 18.4% to $6 million. 
 On a comp store basis, AUR increased 1.1% to $8.95. Transactions per store were up 5.7%, and UPT was down 5.1%. At Arden B, net sales were $12.8 million. That's down 27.5% versus last year and primarily reflects having 22 fewer stores in operation versus a year ago, as well as the difficult retail environment. 
 Comparable store sales were down 6.7% and e-commerce sales declined 21% to $1.3 million. On a comp store basis, AUR increased 2.8% to $28.30. Transactions were down 5.3%, and UPT was down 3.9%. 
 Returning to the income statement. Third quarter gross profit came in at $28.9 million. That's up 11.2% compared to $26 million last year. Gross margin improved 350 basis points to 22.7% versus 19.2% in the third quarter of 2012. The year-over-year improvement reflects an increase of 350 basis points in merchandise margin. 
 Occupancy cost deleveraged by 40 basis points, including about $430,000 of pre-opening costs, which was offset by a collective decline of 40 basis points in buying, distribution, and planning and allocation costs. 
 Third quarter selling, general and administrative expense was $38.7 million or 30.3% of sales. That's down 12.8% on a dollar basis and 250 basis points as a percentage of sales compared to the prior year and included about $240,000 of pre-opening costs. 
 Selling expense in the third quarter totaled $30.6 million or 24% of sales, reflecting a year-over-year decline from $31.5 million or 23.3% of sales in the third quarter of 2012. G&amp;A expenses were also down, coming in at $8.1 million compared to $12.9 million a year ago. As a percentage of sales, G&amp;A declined 320 basis points to 6.3%. As a reminder, the third quarter of last year included $2.1 million in professional fees to defend against a proxy solicitation and $1 million in incremental legal fees. 
 Third quarter operating loss was $14.9 million compared to $24.8 million last year. The results include noncash asset impairment charges of $5.1 million in this year's quarter and $6.5 million in last year's quarter. The 2012 period also includes the professional fees and legal costs I just mentioned. 
 Provision for income taxes was $49,000 compared to a benefit for income taxes of $10 million last year. We ceased recording benefits for income taxes on pretax losses upon establishing evaluation allowance against our deferred tax assets at the end of fiscal 2012. 
 Net loss in the third quarter was $14.9 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, which compares to net loss of $14.8 million or $0.17 per diluted share in the prior year period. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the after-tax effect of the asset impairment charges, adjusted net loss was $9.9 million or $0.12 per diluted share. That compares to a non-GAAP adjusted net loss of $9.7 million or $0.11 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2012. 
 Moving now to the balance sheet. Inventories at quarter end stood at $42.6 million, down 7.8% versus last year. This was in line with our expectations and reflects our strategy to ensure the company was in a clean position at the start of the holiday season. Inventory per square foot was down 5% versus a year ago, with Wet Seal down 3% and Arden B down 20%. 
 The company remains in strong financial condition and ended the quarter with $66 million of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments and no debt. This level of cash provides us with the ability to remain nimble in today's operating environment and the flexibility to plan for unit growth in 2014. 
 Capital expenditures totaled $7 million in the third quarter, which includes spending related to 10 new store openings during the period, as well as preparation for another 12 new openings that occurred in November. We expect fiscal 2013 net capital expenditures to be in the range of $22 million to $23 million, with roughly 3/4 of our planned expenditures being store-related. 
 Now I'll turn to our financial guidance for the fourth quarter of 2013. Our expectations are as follows: Net sales in the range of $134 million to $137 million; a comparable store sales decrease in the high single to low double digits; gross margin in the range of 21.9% to 23.2%; SG&amp;A between 31.7% and 32.4%; and operating loss ranging from $11.6 million to $14.1 million; and we expect a net loss in the range of $0.14 to $0.17 per diluted share. 
 Thanks for your time this afternoon. Now I'll ask the operator to open up the call for questions.

 I would now like to turn the call over to Tom. 
 Thomas P. Johnson 
 Thank you, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before I begin, I'd like to welcome Susan Lewis, who has joined our team as Vice President, Investor and Media Relations, succeeding Ken, who has moved into a role in our international business. Ken and Susan will work together during the transition period. 
 I'll start today with a high-level review of our third quarter performance and our results from Black Friday weekend. Following comments from Emilia and Marc onto the quarter and holiday, I will outline the initiatives we're taking to improve our results as we head into the new year. 
 Our performance in the third quarter was clearly disappointing. While comparable sales declined in line with our year-to-date trend, we were more promotional than anticipated in order to position ourselves for the fourth quarter. Sales in what historically had been core categories, graphics and fleece, remained weak. We were encouraged, however, with the increase of our conversion rates and our customers' response to our new fashion merchandise in certain categories, as well as our new sub-brand, Live Love Dream. 
 Turning to our performance over the Black Friday weekend. We executed and integrated merchandise, marketing and social media plan, while navigating an increasingly promotional and competitive teen retail environment. Our holiday marketing campaign, Wish For It, generated record numbers of teen engagement across all social media channels, and we were able to create excitement around our holiday product. 
 During the extended Thanksgiving holiday weekend, our comparable sales decreased mid-single digits. While we were encouraged with the improvement in trends over the holiday weekend versus our third quarter run rate, we believe it is prudent to be cautious with our outlook for the remainder of the holiday period given the inconsistent trends in our business. As you know, our entire organization [Audio Gap] diligently with a sense of urgency on transforming our brand and our business. The structural changes that have been happening within the world of teen retail have profoundly influenced how we think and the way we approach our customer. To better understand these changes, we've conducted countless independent focus groups, leveraged the knowledge of our over 20,000 teen employees and formed an internal customer insights group headed by our EVP of Customer Engagement. The findings have been consistent and clear. Today's teen wants more options, more personal interaction with brands and more flexibility in how they access these brands. We understand the shifts that have taken place, and we continue to aggressively respond to these changes. 
 Over the past year, the team has given our customer more choice with a wider assortment of fashion, exciting new sub-brands and new categories, such as footwear, all presented in a curated, collection-driven approach; significantly invested in social media with the goal of connecting more directly with our teen consumer, building our social media team and creating grassroots marketing efforts and partnerships with relevant social media personalities and icons; addressed changes in the way the consumers are accessing brands by investing in the look and feel of our e-commerce site and the development of mobile platforms. With exclusive styles and expanded categories such as third-party footwear and home, we also continued to rightsize our fleet through an accelerated store closure program and focused our energies on our most profitable and volume-driving doors. 
 As we noted on the last quarter's call, we recognize that the turnaround in our business is taking longer than expected. We have made progress this year in executing our key initiatives. However, it takes time for customers to recognize the changes that we made in our brand. This delay in customer adoption is particularly magnified by weak mall traffic and a highly promotional retail environment. As we continue through the holiday period and into next year, we are more determined than ever to improve our performance. 
 Our priorities remain consistent: Focus on customer acquisition by differentiating the Aeropostale brand through compelling product, coupled with marketing and social media programs that are relevant and connect emotionally with our customer. 
 I'd now like to turn the call over to Emilia, who will take you through some of our recent merchandising highlights. 
 Emilia Fabricant 
 Good afternoon, everyone. As Tom mentioned, we operated in a challenging and highly promotional environment during the third quarter, and this environment has continued as we have entered the holiday selling period. In the third quarter, we were encouraged with positive trends we experienced in key areas where we added newness to our assortments. In women's, we experienced strengths in sweaters, woven pants, footwear and the new Live Love Dream collection, consisting of active tops and pants, yoga, intimates and lounge. 
 In Men's, we experienced good performance in sweaters, wovens and short-sleeve knits. While traffic trends remained weak during the quarter, we realized higher AURs and healthy sell-throughs on certain fashion styles and maintained our value proposition in core. As we called out earlier, we were very encouraged by the positive consumer response to new merchandise categories and sub-brands we have introduced. 
 Our logo business, including graphics and fleece, trended down, but we are seeing an improvement in our inventory sales ratio in these categories. Denim and knit tops also underperformed. During the Thanksgiving weekend, we experienced an improvement in overall trends from the third quarter with stronger performance in categories that were more fashion-oriented along with continued strength in Live Love Dream. 
 Throughout this year, we have approached our assortments by building collections to meet our girls' various moods and activities. We know that she wants complete outfits that are relevant when she is lounging around, going to school or out with friends on a Friday night. We also made significant changes to trim, the finishing and the authenticity of our product with the particular focus on quality and hand-feel. We have projected a true lifestyle approach in our stores, making strong product statements at the front door, throughout the selling floor and in our marketing. Operationally, we've reduced product lead times; created more flexibility in our sourcing model, allowing more open size [ph]; and improved product distortion and localization. 
 Moving onto the remainder of the holiday season and into next year, we intend to continue to build on these initiatives. We plan to further refine our merchandising mix, including the expansion of our fashion basics areas. As Tom said earlier, the teen is looking for more differentiated product options and brands that connect with their lifestyle. In just a few months, the team did an amazing job developing our lifestyle sub-brand, Live Love Dream, which has now evolved into a substantial business from concept to stores. We are looking forward to leveraging our speed and power to continue to develop and incubate new sub-brands that are exclusively at Aeropostale. 
 You may have noticed the self-made teen social media sensation and celebrity, Bethany Mota, began blogging about us earlier this year. We are thrilled to be expanding that relationship for the holiday season, partnering with Bethany to introduce a new collection, Bethany Mota exclusively at Aeropostale. 
 We launched a Twitter campaign to reveal pieces within the collection and had Bethany appear at 1 of our stores. Over the course of just 5 weeks, over 0.5 million people tweeted to unlock these looks. The collection truly underscores how we are evolving our business in terms of relevancy and speed to market as the line progressed from concept to launch in just 3 months. We have also started a similar partnership with Warner Bros. for Pretty Little Liars, which is both the most highly watched and tweeted about television program by female teen viewers. The first-ever Pretty Little Liars collection, which was designed in partnership with Mandi Line, the show's costume designer, will launch in stores on January 6 and will feature looks for each of the 4 main characters. We hope you all take time to see both of these collections over the next month in our stores. 
 I will now turn the call over to Marc, who will take you through the financials. 
 Marc D. Miller 
 Thank you, Emilia. Before I begin my third quarter review, I would like to underscore our entire organization's commitment to maintaining the financial discipline that is necessary to appropriately steward the business during this repositioning of the Aeropostale brand. I'll discuss these financial initiatives in more detail after I cover our third quarter results. 
 Total net sales for the quarter were down 15% versus last year, reflecting a negative 15% comp, which includes our e-commerce channel. Including our e-commerce channel, our girls and guys businesses were both down 15% for the quarter. 
 Our comp for the quarter was driven by a 10% decrease in transactions and a 7% decline in average unit retail, partially offset by a 2% increase in units per transaction. During the quarter, we opened 3 Aeropostale and 6 P.S. from Aeropostale stores. We closed 4 Aero stores in the third quarter, bringing our year-to-date total closings to 17. Accordingly, we ended the quarter with 976 Aero and 148 P.S. stores. 
 On a GAAP basis, including store asset impairment charges of $5.1 million, gross margins for the quarter were 17.1%. On an adjusted basis, excluding the impairment charges, gross margins for the quarter were 18.1% versus 27.9% last year. The 980 basis point decrease was driven by 690 basis points of lower merchandise margins and 290 basis points from the de-leveraging of non-merchandise COGS. 
 SG&amp;A for the quarter was 25.1% of sales versus 20.9% last year. Our SG&amp;A for the quarter included a retirement plan charge related to the payment to our former President of $0.6 million and extraordinary legal fees of $1.5 million. Excluding the aforementioned charges, SG&amp;A would have been relatively flat in dollars versus last year. 
 Our tax rate for the quarter was 38.0% against our original expectation of 35.5%. This resulted in a net loss of approximately $25.6 million or $0.33 per diluted share. On an adjusted basis, the net loss for the quarter was $22.9 million or $0.29 per diluted share. 
 Cash and cash equivalents at the close of the quarter were $68 million versus $184 million last year. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $263 million, down 5% in total or down 11% on a retail per square foot basis and down 7% in units. 
 Our capital expenditures for the quarter were approximately $24 million, and depreciation and amortization was approximately $16 million. 
 I will now discuss our guidance outlook. Our business quarter-to-date continues to experience pressure, and we expect the macroeconomic landscape, weak consumer spending and heavily promotional environment in the teen retail sector to continue to affect our financial performance. Accordingly, we are initiating guidance for the fourth quarter at a loss of $0.24 to $0.32 per diluted share. This guidance excludes the impact of any potential store asset impairment charges and assumes a share count of 78.9 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 33 -- 36%. 
 Additionally, as part of our expanded and accelerated store closing plan for the year, we plan to close 29 stores in Q4, bringing our total store closings for the year to approximately 46 compared to our original expectation of 15 to 20 in 2013. 
 Now that I've discussed our third quarter results and guidance for the fourth quarter, I would like to take a moment to update everyone on our financial strategies over the longer term. As I said earlier, we are committed to upholding a financially-prudent capital structure that allows us to steward the business through today's retail challenges, while supporting our product and branding efforts. These financial strategies include maintaining appropriate levels of liquidity, optimizing our real estate portfolio and managing our expenses prudently. 
 Our first financial priority is to maintain appropriate levels of liquidity by managing our working capital closely through actions such as controlled inventory buys and leaving flexibility in open-to-buy for Chase. Additionally, we have access to $175 million revolver to help augment our liquidity. We did not draw down on our revolver during our peak working capital cycle in the third quarter, and we do not expect to do so at any point in the fourth quarter. Looking ahead, we are reducing our capital expenditures significantly in 2014 and plan to spend approximately $35 million versus an expected $82 million in 2013, which is also down from our initial plan of $89 million. Clearly, we have taken aggressive steps to reduce our capital spending versus initial plans at historical levels. 
 Our second financial priority lies in optimizing our real estate portfolio by accelerating our store closure program, while refocusing our store fleet primarily on the highest volume and most productive locations. Based on the acceleration of our store closure program, we now expect to close a total of approximately 175 Aeropostale stores over the next few years compared to our previous plans to close approximately 100 stores over the same period. In addition, we plan to open a limited number of new stores in 2014, catering to the teens' shifted shopping preferences. With respect to Aero, we expect to open 11 Aeropostale stores with virtually all of them located in highly-productive outlet centers. With P.S., we plan to limit the number of new store openings to 5 next year and focus our efforts on making the chain profitable with the critical mass of stores we have already achieved with this younger brand. Our real estate plans also include selective remodeling of a limited number of Aero stores to our new store -- studio store format. Currently, we expect to remodel 26 stores in 2014 through partial or full remodels compared to the 30 full remodels that we will complete in 2013. As always, we will continue to regularly review performance across our store fleet as part of our real estate optimization efforts. 
 Our third financial priority is expense management. This year, we increased our investments in crucial areas of our business, such as marketing, social media, new brand development, international and GoJane while offsetting most of this incremental spend through reductions in all other areas of our business. We plan to maintain our strong financial discipline as we continue to invest in these critical drivers of our brand transformation. We will continue to carefully evaluate all potential investments and discretionary expenses, as well as closely manage headcount into next year. 
 Now I will turn the call over to Tom for closing remarks. 
 Thomas P. Johnson 
 Thank you, Marc. In the beginning of the year, we laid out key strategic initiatives surrounding the evolution of our product, the redefinition of our brand projection, the focus of our processes and infrastructure and the investment in our future growth drivers. All of these initiatives continue to be the foundation for future success of our company, and the team is working aggressively in executing our strategy. What historically has made us successful, logo and price alone, are not the keys to success in the future. Today's teen wants more choice and unique and differentiated product at a value. 
 In order to execute within the new paradigm, over the past year, we've added significant talent across our entire product development team. I think you have all seen the aggressive steps this new team has taken this year to transform our merchandise assortment and worked towards achieving the right mix of product. Ongoing refinement to our merchandise and merchandise mix and delivering relevant, differentiated and unique product that is available exclusively at Aeropostale will continue to be the most important area of focus. We will continue to develop sub-brands and brand extensions and pursue alliances with key influencers that are relevant to today's teen. 
 Brand projection to drive customer acquisition also remains a top priority. This is the first all-digital generation with access to more information over a multitude of touch points than ever before. Teens want brands to interact with them, solicit and apply their input and align with their values. To better understand our teen, we have begun piloting a loyalty program and remained committed to the structured customer insights and employee brand ambassador programs. We will continue to invest in social media, connect with our consumers through crowd sourcing and new engagement techniques and leverage our industry-leading number of fans and followers on social media channels. 
 Additionally, we are working with a prominent New York branding firm to refine our DNA platform and brand positioning. In regards to process and infrastructure, we plan to direct efforts towards product optimization, including further improvements in allocation and size optimization and tiered buying. We continue to evaluate changes in our merchandise flow processes to match the current shopping patterns of our teen consumer. 
 Finally, we plan to continue to grow e-commerce, international and position P.S. for future expansion. As Marc discussed, we are slowing growth for P.S. next year as we reduce capital expenditures and work towards in making the brand profitable. We intend to continue to implement initiatives for P.S. that are designed to further increase brand awareness, optimize our assortments and build on our current in-store experience. 
 Before we turn the call over for your questions, I would like to address the recent shareholder letter sent to the Board of Directors and the Board's adoption of the shareholder rights plan. We're always open to hearing views and feedback from all of our shareholders. The board's action reflects its ongoing commitment to maximizing value for all shareholders. Given we are currently in a peak holiday season and this is a critical time of year for every retailer, our team is concentrating its full energies on executing our business. We are not commenting any further on these items at this time. 
 I want to thank all of our employees across our organization for their hard work and dedication over the holiday selling period. Longer term, we continue to believe that we have the right strategy and the right team in place to execute on the initiatives that will drive improvement in our performance and allow us to generate substantial growth. We look forward to sharing our continued progress with you in the upcoming months. 
 Operator, we are now ready to take questions.

 Mark B. Weinswig 
 Thank you, Vic, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'm going to focus my discussion on our fourth fiscal quarter operating results and our balance sheet and briefly discuss our financial highlights for the full fiscal year. Please note that we have included additional information in our press release regarding the non-GAAP figures. 
 Consolidated revenue for our fourth fiscal quarter totaled $43.1 million, which is an increase of $9.6 million or 29% over the previous quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher Photovoltaic revenue as we had a significant increase in our international business, including a large order that had been pushed from Q3. Our Q4 revenue guidance was $42 million to $45 million. 
 On a segment basis, our Photovoltaics business accounted for $20.5 million or 47% of the company's total revenue. This represents an $8.6 million or 72% increase from the prior quarter. As we have said previously, while we remain confident in the long-term prospects of the Photovoltaics business, our revenues in any given quarter may be a bit lumpy. In Q4, we experienced this lumpiness when the delivery of an international shipment of a few million dollars was not delivered in Q3. 
 The Fiber Optics segment accounted for $22.6 million or 53% of the company's total revenue. This represents an increase of roughly $1 million or 5% from the prior quarter. Hong will discuss the outlook for the Fiber Optics business later in the call. 
 On a segment basis, Photovoltaic gross margin decreased 15 percentage points to 13.5%. The primary reason for the decrease was a significant increase in our lower-margin international revenue. We continue to believe that this business's target gross margin is at roughly 30%. 
 Fiber Optics' gross margin was 11.6%, 8.6 percentage points higher than the prior quarter. While we have seen a significant improvement in our Tunable XFP product yields and margins, this manufacturing line is still underutilized and margins are below our average Fiber Optic gross margins. We expect our gross margins in the Fiber Optics segment to improve in future quarters as we complete the ramp-up of our new product line at our contract manufacturer and our Fiber Optics revenues increase. 
 Consolidated gross margin was 12.5%, roughly flat with the prior quarter. Total operating expenses for R&amp;D, SG&amp;A were $12.5 million, excluding any flood-related charges and recoveries, gain on sale of assets, legal settlements and impairment charges. The increase in our operating expenses from the prior quarter was primarily due to increases in certain R&amp;D expenses related to our Solar business. We believe that our operating expenses should be at around the $11.5 million to $12 million range per quarter going forward, with our Q1 operating expenses being a little higher due to certain corporate-related cost. 
 During the fourth quarter, we recognized a $4.8 million gain from the sale of our stake in our joint venture. The cash from this investment sale has been collected. The net book value of our investment was $0 at the time of the sale. 
 On a GAAP basis, the consolidated net loss for the fourth quarter was $2.3 million. Our GAAP net loss per basic share and diluted share was $0.08. Our non-GAAP net loss, after excluding certain adjustments, all of which are set forth in the non-GAAP tables included in today's release, was a loss of $5.6 million versus $5.9 million in the prior quarter. Please note that we have included additional information regarding amortization, stock comp and other items in today's release. 
 Now onto order backlog, which we define as purchase orders or supply agreements accepted by the company with expected product delivery and/or services to be performed within the next 12 months. At September 30, the company had a Space Solar order backlog of approximately $57 million versus $58 million at the end of the prior quarter. 
 Moving on to the balance sheet. At the end of September, the company's cash and cash equivalents was roughly $16.9 million. The increase was primarily due to the fundraising activities we completed in the September quarter and the sale of our joint venture interest. We ended the quarter with $41.8 million in receivables, our highest level in the past few years. The increase was primarily due to sales with slower-paying international customers. In the past 2 months, we have reduced the outstanding AR levels by more than $7 million. Going forward, we expect our sales to international customers to decrease and therefore, our DSO levels to be more in line with our historical average of roughly 60 to 65 days. 
 Looking back over the past year, we have made significant strides in improving the business structure and our operations. A few of our accomplishments include: EMCORE was profitable on a GAAP basis in the fiscal year; and of course, net income improved by more than $44 million over the prior year; revenues and gross margins increased over the prior year; and our operating expenses, specifically SG&amp;A and R&amp;D, fell by almost $10 million year-over-year. 
 While we are pleased by the year-over-year performance, we need to show further progress as we continue to execute on our business plan. With that, I will turn the call over to Hong, who will discuss the company's strategic and operating initiatives and provide revenue guidance for the first quarter. 
 Hong Q. Hou 
 Thanks, Mark. Good afternoon, everyone. As Mark discussed, we achieved a consolidated revenue of $43.1 million in the September quarter. This represents a 29% sequential increase. Revenues increased for both Fiber Optics and Photovoltaic segments, Photovoltaic increasing by $8 million and Fiber Optics by $1 million. 
 Our Photovoltaic business remains strong, although it did experience a reduction in gross margin due to unfavorable margin from the CPV solar cell sales to terrestrial solar market. We experienced marked recovery of our Broadband Fiber Optics business and operating performance in both -- improvement in the telecom product division. We continue to improve our cost structure and believe that we can reach breakeven at a quarterly revenue level at about $7 million -- $47 million to $48 million. 
 Now let me give you an update on our businesses and how we are responding to the current market conditions. First, I will start with the Space Photovoltaic business segment. The revenue for our Photovoltaic segment in the September quarter was $29.5 million, a near-record level. And the gross margin was 13.5%, significantly lower than the target level of approximately 30%. 
 As we discussed in the last quarter's conference call, we made a deferred shipment to an international customer after receiving permission to ship early in the September quarter. In addition, revenue from CPV solar cell sales in the quarter was at a record level of over $6 million. CPV sales lower in margin, typically with a single-digit gross margin, although they do help absorbed the fixed cost of a solar cell fab. Gross margin, going forward, is expected to improve significantly. 
 For our fiscal year 2013, the total revenue for the Photovoltaic segment of $71.1 million, gross margin was 25.8% and the divisional operating income, $8.6 million. This is for the whole fiscal year 2013. This represents significant improvement from fiscal year 2012, the divisional revenue in 2012 of $64.7 million, gross margin of 24.2% and operating income of $2.5 million. 
 In the past quarter, the Space Photovoltaic division was awarded more than 15 separate orders from several major aerospace primes [ph] in the U.S. and in Asia. This contract serves both the U.S. government and commercial satellite missions, with a total value of -- in excess of $20 million. As a result, the order backlog for this division as of September 30 for delivery over the next 12 months showed a total of $57 million, which is very close to the record level of $58 million in the last quarter. 
 EMCORE is in the process of finalizing negotiations on long-term agreements for 100% of the solar product requirements from 2 major aerospace companies. With this, our outlook for the fiscal year 2014 for this segment looks very solid. By leveraging the business and production infrastructure, we're pursuing business opportunities for a product at a higher integration level, such as the solar panels, adjacent [ph] markets, such as high-end mobile power for defense applications. I expect to see business contributions from these areas towards the latter part of next year. 
 Now let me discuss our market position and business outlook in our Fiber Optics business segment. In the broadband cable TV business, shipments increased over the June quarter. We are keeping track on the CapEx spending of MSOs very closely. Reported by the 2 major service providers that the overall CapEx spending for the September quarter was flat sequentially. But they expect their spending related to the product lines, namely scalable infrastructures and upgrade to increase for the remainder of the year. In addition to the normal business flow, we are supporting our customers with a number of large international opportunities. When they materialize, this will significantly contribute to our business. 
 The industry in cable TV continue to be dynamic in formulating and finalizing their equipment design strategy to better utilize a new standard of DOCSIS 3.1 and the CCAP. The primary objective is to modernize the MAC and the physical layers and spectral plan to increase our transmission bandwidth with the existing cable plant infrastructure, improve power efficiencies and channel densities. 
 New ideas for transmitters and receivers such as XFPs and return path QAM transmitters are emerging. We are engaging with all the equipment manufacturers very closely in designing and qualifying transmitter and receiver products which comply with these new standards. 
 We are finishing some final touches on the disruptive laser technology. It offers a high power modulation and transmission for the linearity -- with a linearity performance similar to the externally modulated transmitters. The cost and the power consumption will be greatly reduced. It has been the highly sought-after solution for years and our customers are quite excited. 
 One additional area that has generated significant market traction is the optical component sales for DAS or Distributed Antenna System applications. Our customers and system integrators are retrofitting, for instance, football fields with new broadband infrastructure to allow spectators to get live and interactive experiences on their mobile devices. Optical components needed to be very linear in their electro-optical performance and our technology fits extremely well. We started seeing a noticeable contribution of the business from this application. 
 Another important development is that a product enabled by our linearized optoelectronic components for Fiber Optic Gyros is finally about to become a commercial reality. It has been largely a development project over the last several years. Due to the superior performance and the reduced cost compared to the incumbents, we are getting production contracts from multiple prime contractors. This can increase our revenues quite meaningfully when the volume shipment begins in April 2014 -- starting from April 2014. 
 The revenue from the Cable TV Broadband business is expected to show a continued improvement in the December quarter. We are optimistic about the future of this business based on the engagement levels and the qualification activities on our new products, as well as the CapEx outlook given by the MSOs. When we finish the manufacturing consolidation this quarter for all cable TV production lines, we believe the business can turn to profitability with a further improved revenue level to about $17 million a quarter. 
 Moving on to our business in Telecom segment. During the September quarter the revenue from the telecom product lines were down slightly compared to the June quarter. Shipment of ITLAs is near the record level. However, the revenue stayed about the same due to some price erosion. We entered into a VMI or Vendor-Managed Inventory agreement with a major customer on Tunable XFP product during the quarter. As a result, the revenue from Tunable XFPs did not contribute as much as we anticipated. 
 Deployment of 100-gig optical transport product with long-haul networks has been a real success story. It was reported that shipments of 100-gig DWDM ports reached 15,000 in the first half of 2013. And that are projected to climb to 40,000 for the whole year. While these numbers remain modest compared to the shipments of 10-gig and even 40-gig DWDM ports, the contribution of 100-gig ports to overall network bandwidth is already significant. Coherent standard is proliferating to the metro and to even data center space. Market for the metro is expected to be 3x as large as the telco. So the demand is projected to increase significantly over the next years. 
 Optical components for the 100-gig are becoming more competitive on the other hand. The price erosion has been accelerated due to the new entrants in the space. EMCORE's products still have a lead in performance. The pricing becomes more important to some customers who had less stringent requirement for their network's performance. During the annual bidding, price erosion is about 10%. 
 On the micro-ITLA front, we continue to support more than 10 design programs in customer qualification and production ramp-up activities for 100-gig coherent transponders and line cards. The first volume is expected to start in this month. EMCORE is well positioned to the ramp up. We expect a significant increase in demand for our micro-ITLAs once the customers commence volume manufacturing for their new line cards early 2014. 
 And for the Tunable XFPs, we had some challenges early in the new product introduction. Yield was low in the cycle time and the manufacturing was long. We have been working on the yield improvement and the cycle time reduction over the last several months in optimizing and improving the design and assembly and testing processes. I'm happy to report today that we have finally resolved all the significant issues in testing and assembly. 
 Current yields in all areas are above 90%. These improved yields has been shown to be sustainable. With the yield and capacity improvement in Tunable XFPs, we are about -- we're able to ramp. However, we see a pause in demand increase with a major customer reporting slowdown in current Tunable XFP demand. We believe, however, that Tunable XFPs will be serving the telecom industry at the workforce [ph] for 10-gigabit transmission for many years to come. Therefore, we started a new program to drastically reduce the cost of the Tunable TOSA, which is a key component in Tunable XFP. 
 This low-cost laser engine can reduce a Tunable XFP cost significantly. It also enables low-power Tunable XFP plus transceivers. With that, we are working aggressively to further reduce the cost structure, improve our product competitiveness. This will help drive the customer penetration. We're confident about the competitive advantage of EMCORE's Tunable XFP in both negative and 0 chirp with a full-band Tunable ability, better OSNR and a higher output power. These are the key attribute requirements for replacing 300-pin transponders. We have started this year. 
 We successfully demonstrated 100-gigabit DP-QPSK integrated coherent transmitter at the ECOC in London back in September. And now narrow [ph] along with Tunable laser integrated with the best-in-class indium phosphide IQ modulator, this represents a first demonstration of 100-gig ICT or integrated coherent transmitter in the industry. This integrated capability will enable the industry to transition to a smaller form factors and eventually to say CFP2 or CFP4 solutions. The success of the demonstration underscores our advanced technical capability and commitment to delivering innovative and enabling solutions to our high-speed communications customers. In addition, we are actively pursuing applications for metro and data centers utilizing our core technology in these areas. 
 We made solid progress for year 2013 in the Fiber Optics segment. Having devoted much resources, intention to recover from the flood disasters in fiscal year 2012, we experienced an unprecedented slowdown in the cable TV industry in the early 2013. But we are now seeing solid recovery. We have improved our production yield to a respectable level for Tunable XFPs after challenges in the new product introduction. We introduced a micro-ITLA to production and improved the processes throughout the ramp-up process and expected this product to ramp shortly. Although we've faced some challenges in execution, EMCORE's product performance and technology leadership is very evident in the industry. We will work diligently on capitalizing our strengths for the next fiscal year. 
 The revenue from our Fiber Optics segment in 2013 was approximately $97 million. It shows a slight sequential increase compared to 2012. Gross margin improved from 4.5% over 10%. We do expect a significant improvement for our 2014 fiscal year results due to the dramatically improved yield and product cost as our new products are moving into production at a higher yield in the margins. 
 In light of the challenges in our Fiber Optics business, we have completed realignment in engineering, operations and general management functions over the last several months. Most recently, we welcomed Dr. L.C. Chiu as our new General Manager for our Fiber Optics business. Dr. Chiu is a veteran in the Fiber Optics industry, bringing over 20 years of experience in engineering design, manufacturing, quality and business processes and a wealth of knowledge and expertise in the fiber optics industry. With his deep technical and operations background, we believe he can drive further improvements in our business for new product introduction, cost reduction and operational efficiency. We are optimistic about the future contribution from him. 
 I'd also like to use this opportunity to provide an update on changes to our board structure. Back in October 2013, Becker Drapkin Management acquired approximately 8% of the company's common stock. We filed a 13D stating their intention to be closely involved in the company's strategy and corporate governance going forward. 
 Over the last couple of months, the company has been discussing with Becker Drapkin closely and constructively. I'm happy to report today that we have entered into an agreement. As a result, Steve Becker of Becker Drapkin Management; Dr. Gerry Fine, Professor and Center Director of Boston University; and Steve Domenik, General Partner of Sevin Rosen Funds, have joined EMCORE's Board of Directors effective next Monday, December 9, 2013. They bring significant experience in all different aspects of business and strategy. They are great additions to our Board of Directors. We look forward to working with them closely as we continue to focus on increasing value for our shareholders. 
 Turning to guidance, for the first quarter of fiscal year 2014 ending December, our revenue expectation is in the range of $43 million to $45 million, with the improvement from both the Fiber Optics and Space Photovoltaic segments. We expect to see a significant positive impact to our bottom line due to the increased revenue, more favorable product mix and the yield improvement results. 
 In summary, we feel that we have managed through some significant challenges to the company over the year. Our technology and product are well positioned to address the faster growing areas in the marketplace. We will be focusing on the improving the operations performance, including driving revenue growth, cost reduction and a new product introduction. We've defined a clear operating plan for our fiscal year 2014. We review periodically and drive accountability throughout our organization. We are expecting a significant improvement in the financial performance for the new fiscal year. 
 With that, I will turn the call over to Q&amp;A.

 I would now like to introduce the management team at Mattress Firm. Steve Stagner, Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Black, Chief Financial Officer. Management will make some comments, and then will be available for your questions. 
 With that, I will turn the call over to Mr. Steve Stagner. Steve? 
 R. Stephen Stagner 
 Thank you, Alex. Good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining us on our earnings call. Today, I will briefly highlight our third quarter results, give you an update on the integration of our acquired stores and recent acquisition activity, and then provide perspective on the business. Jim Black will provide a more detailed review of the past quarter's financial results and discuss our revised outlook for the rest of fiscal year 2013. 
 To begin, we would like to emphasize the continued success of our relative market share model, which has allowed us to grow both total and comparable store sales along with adjusted operating income in the third quarter of 2013 despite the ongoing pressure in consumer spending trends. We are pleased with our third quarter results, which were highlighted by a net sales increase of 18% to $326 million and comparable store sales growth of 2.9%, growing earnings per share by 18%, while opening 40 stores which increased our company-operated store base to over 1,150 units. 
 In response to the ongoing pressure from consumer spending trends, we put in place a number of sales initiatives. This, when combined with the early effects of increased manufacturer advertising, helped us drive increased unit sales and market share growth starting late in the third quarter and continuing into November. These initiatives include: number one, an enhanced emphasis on unit capture and market share gain through increased transactions; secondly, taking a more aggressive approach on a handful of select price points; and finally, broadening the availability of third-party consumer financing. We are confident that we can build on these recent trends and continue to drive unit sales performance because of the following factors. To begin with, we have softer prior year sales comparisons in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. Secondly, we anticipate -- the anticipated ongoing advertising media spend by manufacturers focused on the higher-end specialty category; and finally, ongoing improvement in acquired stores, albeit with a smaller impact from the former Mattress Giant stores, given that they are now comping against improved results. While we are excited about the improvement in sales trends that we have started to achieve from these initiatives, we made a deliberate decision to capture additional units, which has resulted, as expected, in a trade-off in margins. Given the ongoing consumer environment, we feel that this trade-off has been effective in allowing us to grow our bottom line while driving same-store unit growth. While we don't view this as a long-term shift in strategy, we will remain focused on driving same-store sales and units, so long as this choppy retail environment persists. 
 Now let me provide some additional color on our third quarter results. Our acquired stores continue to perform well. In particular, the former Mattress Giant stores we acquired in May of 2012 delivered approximately 15% comparable store sales growth and contributed approximately 200 basis points of comparable store sales improvement for the quarter. The strong performance in our markets where we acquired the former Mattress Giant stores continue to validate the strength of our relative market share strategy. We drove same-store unit growth of 4.2% in the quarter as a result of these sales initiatives, and from strong sales performance at an annual state fair event. Same-store unit growth was also driven by improved conversion and an uptick in traffic once all of our initiatives were executed and the early effects of increased manufacturer advertising begin to take hold. As we chose to capture a greater number of the units available, we deliberately traded off some average unit price or AUP and product gross margin. During the quarter, AUP decreased 130 basis points and product gross margin decreased 110 basis points. However, with this AUP decline, there was an AUP increase in the specialty category on a like-for-like basis. 
 The 2.9% increase in our comparable store sales was driven by a 4.2% increase in same-store units, partially offset by a 1.3% decrease in AUP. The improvement in our comparable store sales began to gain traction in October as a result of these initiatives. Looking forward, we are optimistic that the pullback in the industry level advertising directed towards the high-end consumer is now largely behind us, which helps explain our sequential gain in specialty mattress sales mix from the second quarter to the third quarter. We are pleased that our sales initiatives and the early effects of increased manufacturer advertising helped us improve upon our first half comparable store sales trends, allowing us to achieve, as expected, positive comparable store sales in the third quarter. We will continue to concentrate on the basic pillars of our business in the areas of selling intensity, merchandising assortment, real estate quality and advertising effectiveness that are intended to maintain an excellent buying experience for our customers. 
 Now let me give you an update on the Mattress Giant acquisition that happened in May of 2012 and other recent acquisition activities. As highlighted in the chart included in today's earnings release, the former Mattress Giant stores continue to outperform the balance of the chain, albeit at a lower percentage than prior quarters due to the fact that their productivity is getting closer to that of the overall chain average and the stores have anniversary-ed their rebranding as Mattress Firm. The increased advertising spend in the markets where the former Mattress Giant stores are located continued to drive significant sales and market share increases, and has helped offset cannibalization of our legacy stores. As these acquired stores have continued to ramp up their sales, we have achieved expense leverage and operating margin expansion. This is further evidence that our core relative market share strategy is working. Now that our organization has had a chance to fully integrate our previous acquisitions, we are excited to update you on the progress of 2 recent additions that we have pursued following the third quarter. Once completed, these acquisitions will add 44 stores to the chain, primarily in Wisconsin and Nebraska. Jim will provide additional details. 
 Due to the strength of our new sales initiative and ability to open a large number of productive stores, we are increasing our sales and new store guidance for the remainder of the year. It's important to keep in mind that our deliberate effort to capture additional units came with a trade-off in margin. And as a result, we expect to remain within the previously stated earnings per share range, the details of which will be provided by Jim. 
 In closing, despite a weak overall bedding environment, the company achieved strong growth during the third quarter of 2013 from organic new store openings, continued strong performance from our previous acquisitions and comparable store sales growth. As a leader in our industry, we continue to believe in our relative market share model. We are optimistic for the remainder of the year and look forward to creating additional value for our shareholders. 
 I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Jim Black. 
 James R. Black 
 Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon. I'll focus my commentary on the fiscal third quarter that ended October 29, and then our fiscal 2013 guidance. During the third quarter, we reported adjusted EPS of $0.55, an increase of 18.1% over adjusted EPS of the prior year quarter. Adjusted EPS for the current quarter excludes costs of our ongoing ERP implementation project that are included in our GAAP results. Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis, including these costs, were $0.53 based on weighted outstanding diluted shares of 34.1 million. 
 Net sales in the third quarter were $326 million, an increase of $49 million or 18% over the same period of the prior year. The increase in sales included comparable store sales growth of 2.9%, adding $7.9 million in sales during the quarter. Stores we opened and acquired added incremental net sales of $45.1 million, and stores we closed reduced net sales by $4.1 million during the quarter. 
 Comparable store sales growth of 2.9% was comprised of a 4.2% increase in unit sales, offset partially by a 1.3% decrease in AUP, which was related to the sales initiatives that Steve described. As for the cadence of comparable store sales results during the third quarter, we experienced a continuation of the relatively flat growth of the fiscal second quarter through the end of September. 
 As we entered October, the sales initiatives that Steve mentioned took effect and drove a significant amount of comparable store sales growth throughout the chain through the end of the third quarter. Furthermore, the 2.9% total comparable store sales increase for the quarter included approximately 200 basis points from the former Mattress Giant stores acquired in May 2012, and approximately 150 basis points from sales generated at a large annual state fair event that occurred over 3 weeks in late September and early October. 
 During the third quarter, sales of Specialty Mattress products comprised 44.3% of our net sales, compared with 52.2% during the prior year quarter, while sales of conventional mattresses comprised 46.5% of our net sales compared with 39.4% during the prior year quarter. While we continue to experience a higher mix of conventional mattress products sales versus the prior year, reflecting the industry's resurgence in innerspring and hybrid products, the mix of specialty mattress sales increased sequentially by 160 basis points during the third quarter. The company opened 40 stores during the third quarter while closing 6, bringing the total number of company-operated stores to 1,155 at the end of the third quarter. Year-to-date, the company has opened 121 stores while closing 23. 
 Gross profit increased 14.4% to $126 million in the third quarter compared to the same period of the prior year. As a percentage of sales, gross profit decreased 110 basis points to 38.6% over the prior year. On an adjusted basis, excluding acquisition-related costs incurred in the prior year, the decrease was 130 basis points. This adjusted decrease has several significant components: 
 First, product gross margins decreased 110 basis points from the prior year. There was no significant change in the term under which we purchased merchandise, and the decline was a result of sales initiatives described by Steve that successfully drove unit sales during the latter part of the third quarter. 
 Second, comparable store sales growth drove leverage over store occupancy and other constant recurring costs, resulting in gross margin expansion of 30 basis points during the third quarter. The anniversary of the Mattress Giant acquisition, which occurred at the beginning of the second quarter, continues to drive year-over-year expense leverage as we expected, and the 30-basis-point increase in overall gross margin included 50 basis points of improvement attributable to the acquired stores. Third, our entrance into new markets, which results in lower leverage over store occupancy, warehousing and other operating costs while we ramp up sales, resulted in 40 basis points of expense deleverage. And finally, there was a combined net decrease in gross margin of 10 basis points across several smaller categories due primarily to normal fluctuations. 
 Sales and marketing expense was $74.6 million for the quarter, an increase of $7.1 million over the prior year. Sales and marketing expense as a percentage of net sales improved by 150 basis points to 22.9% compared to the prior year period. The advertising expense component of sales and marketing increased $3.8 million to $26.8 million for the third quarter. Advertising as a percentage of net sales improved by 10 basis points during the third quarter to 8.2%. 
 The non-advertising components of sales and marketing expense, consisting mainly of salesman compensation, increased $3.3 million to $47.8 million for the quarter, primarily as a result of the increase in net sales. This expense, as a percentage of net sales, improved by 140 basis points over the prior year to 14.7%. As a reminder, we reported 100 basis points of expense deleverage in this category during our third quarter earnings call of last year that was attributed to the temporary inefficiencies in salesman staffing levels resulting from the Mattress Giant acquisition. 
 General and administrative expense on a GAAP basis increased $0.3 million to $21.2 million for the third quarter as compared with the prior year period. This expense as a percentage of net sales improved by 100 basis points to 6.5% compared to the prior year period on a GAAP basis. On an adjusted basis, general and administrative expense increased 30 basis points to 6.2%, excluding $1 million of the ERP implementation cost in the current year and $4.4 million of acquisition-related cost in the prior year. The increase in expense in this category over the prior year reflects ongoing investment in our corporate infrastructure to support our growth initiatives and higher ongoing costs related to our new ERP system. 
 On a GAAP basis, operating margin was 9.7% in the third quarter. On an adjusted basis, operating margin declined 10 basis points compared to the prior year to 10.0%. In summary, the significant changes in adjusted operating margin are comprised of a 130-basis-point decline in gross margin, a 150-basis-point increase from selling and marketing expense leverage and a 30-basis-point decrease from general and administrative expense deleverage. 
 Total other expense for the third quarter, consisting mainly of interest expense, was $2.5 million, an increase of $0.4 million from the prior year due primarily to the 150-basis-point increase in the interest rate on approximately $200 million of outstanding term borrowings under our credit agreement amendment completed in November of 2012. The effective income tax rate was 38.0% for the third quarter, which was slightly below our expected full year effective rate of 38.6%. 
 I'll now turn to the balance sheet and statement of cash flows for a brief review. During the third quarter of 2013, we generated $30.3 million in operating cash flows, incurred $13.5 million in capital expenditures and reduced outstanding debt $7.5 million. At the end of the third quarter, cash was $15.2 million, an increase of $8.9 million during the quarter, with approximately $98 million of availability under our revolving credit facility. Total debt was $225 million, with no outstanding revolver borrowings, and net debt leverage was approximately 1.48x. 
 Now I'll provide more detail on our recent acquisition activities mentioned earlier by Steve. On November 13 of this year, the company completed the acquisition of a small mattress retailer operating under the name Mattress People. The acquired business consists of 5 mattress specialty stores located in Nebraska and Iowa for a total cash purchase price of approximately $1.8 million subject to customary post-close adjustments. The company intends to rebrand the acquired stores as Mattress Firm. 
 On November 26 of this year, the company entered into an agreement to acquire the assets and operations of Perfect Mattress of Wisconsin, LLC, a Mattress Firm franchisee, for a total purchase price of $6.3 million, subject to customary adjustments. The purchase price consideration will consist of cash and a $2.0 million seller note that is payable in quarterly installments over 1 year. 
 Perfect Mattress began its operations as a Mattress Firm franchisee in 2009 and currently operates 39 stores located in Wisconsin and Illinois. The closing of the asset purchase is expected to occur in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2013 and remains subject to the prior satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Both acquisitions occurred after the conclusion of our fiscal third quarter and, aside from subsequent event disclosures, are not reflected or reported in our third quarter financial statements. 
 Now I'll address our updated financial guidance for fiscal 2013, which is comprised of the 52 weeks ended January 28, 2014. We currently expect full year sales in the range of $1.217 billion to $1.221 billion (sic) [$1.224 billion], an increase of approximately 21% as compared with fiscal 2012. The sales estimate includes $2 million to $4 million of incremental sales in the fourth quarter of 2013 from the acquired and to be acquired stores I previously discussed. We currently expect full year adjusted EPS in the range of $1.75 to $1.83, which is unchanged from our previous guidance. Our adjusted EPS estimate excludes incremental expenses directly related to our ERP system rollout and a small amount of acquisition-related cost from recent acquisitions. EPS on a GAAP basis, including these incremental expenses, is expected to be in the range of $1.65 to $1.73. 
 As we have discussed, the company has experienced an improvement in traffic and unit sales in recent weeks and our guidance includes our expectation that those trends will continue through the remainder of the fourth quarter based on information currently available to us. With these improvements, along with the anniversary of comparable store sales declines in the prior year, our sales guidance anticipates mid- to high-single digit comparable store sales growth for the fourth quarter of 2013, resulting in flat to low-single digit comparable store growth for the full fiscal year, including approximately 200 to 250 basis points of comp store growth resulting from fiscal 2012 acquisitions. 
 Our guidance anticipates 140 to 150 new organic stores. Net of closures, we expect net organic store unit increase in the range of 110 to 150 -- 115. This is an increase of 5 net store units from our previous guidance, the majority of which will be added late in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2013, with very little effect on estimated sales for the full year. With the anticipated addition of 44 stores during the fourth quarter from the acquisitions I previously discussed, we expect to end fiscal 2013 with approximately 1,215 company-operated stores. 
 Finally, the company has experienced product margin declines since the beginning of October, and we expect those effects to be present throughout the remainder of the fourth quarter as we remain focused on our efforts to drive traffic and unit sales. In addition, the acquisitions that I previously discussed are expected to have a slight drag of approximately $0.02 on adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter before turning accretive in fiscal 2014. As a result, although we have raised our estimated sales range, we are maintaining our previously estimated adjusted EPS range. 
 This concludes our prepared remarks. And at this point, the operator will open the call for questions. 
 However, before we begin, taking questions, I want to clarify that our revised sales guidance range for fiscal 2013 is $1.217 billion to $1.224 billion. 
 With that operator, please open the call to questions.

AGU," 
   Agrium Inc. (AGU) Citi's 6th Annual Basic Materials Conference Transcript December  4, 2013  1:50 PM ET 
 Stephen Dyer 
 Well, thank you and good afternoon. So, first of all, just -- that’s our forward-looking statement, seems to get longer every time I present. So all can read at your leisure and I will start off by just talking a little bit about Agrium and who we are. 
 As mentioned, we are the largest global retailer today servicing over half a million farmers. We are a leading wholesaler of fertilizer as well through our wholesale division of our company. And if you look at our growth over the last, since we started what we call as our integrated strategy being across the value chain in 2005, we have grown our EBITDA by four times over that time period. 
 And moving forward, we see the potential growth of about 40% in our EBITDA over the next five years as well with several projects that we have across our retail and wholesale business units. And again we are uniquely positioned being across that value chain with our integrated strategy that really puts us in a position to leverage the growth of this industry going forward. 
 So what I will do today is talk about a little bit of our performance, then we will move into talking about being across the value chain in our integrated strategy and the advantages that brings to us as a company. And then we will move into an overview of our business unit starting with our retail business unit, our wholesale business unit, a little bit of our advanced technology and then we will move into taking a look at the industry overall, what we see as the outlook for the industry both short term and long term and then move into the growth opportunities that we have to leverage that growth that we see within our industry. 
 So taking a look at, a little bit of deeper dive into our business units and their performance, you can take a look our wholesale over that time period from 2005 when we started our integrated strategy, we have grown our EBITDA by three times. You can see the tremendous growth that we have been able to accomplish within our retail business growing it by nine times, starting in 2005 with our first acquisition -- major acquisition with Royster-Clark to our latest one which is Viterra, which is the key in retail that we acquired and closed just at the end of October. And then you can see again, overall that has brought a growth of four times overall EBITDA over that time period for the company. 
 So taking a little deeper dive into the makeup of our contribution from our different parts of our business, you can see today we have a very diverse portfolio, again across that value chain. If you look at today versus 2005, our EBITDA contribution from our retail business alone is bigger than the entire company in 2005. And again you could see the breakdown within our retails and the contribution from seed and chemicals as well as fertilizers. 
 So we are just not a fertilizer company within the retail, we have a tremendous amount of seed and fertilizer we provide as well as services. And then you can see we have better balanced portfolio where you go back, nitrogen was well over half of the company. Today it’s about the third of the company in terms of our nitrogen contribution coming from a wholesale side of the business. Again, a very balanced portfolio that we have today across that value chain. 
 So taking a look at -- we have also been a very strong leader and from a capital allocation standpoint, we have grown our dividend recently over the last two years from basically a non-existence to a $3 a share, that’s just over a 3% yield. We have also returned $1.7 billion to shareholders through share buyback as well since October 2012. 
 And again, we have always had part of our strategy as we grow stable parts of our business. We would continue to look at returning capital and increasing our dividend. So in terms of our capital allocation policy overall, we really look at it into three component. The first priority for us is what we call is really sustainability and this is around maintaining a very healthy balance sheet, ensuring we have maintained our investment grade rating. 
 We have always been -- since the inception of Agrium have been investment grade rating, you can see that very important, actually see that as a corporate aspect of having that grade rating, as well as ensuring that we are making appropriate amount of investment back in our base business from a sustaining capital standpoint. 
 The second priority for us is around growth. We continue to be a growth company. We continue to look at growth opportunities as we move forward. We have a great pipeline of growth that I’ll talk about in more detail later on in the presentation and we will continue to be disciplined with that growth as well. Taking a look at how to proceed against buying back shares for example as well as taking a look at what is the appropriate hurdle rate or return we should expect depending on the investments that we are looking at as well. 
 Then the last priority we have is around that return of capital. So again we have grown our dividends significantly. We targeted 25% to 35% of our free cash flow after our sustaining capital returned to shareholders through our dividends. So basically at that level today, at the upfront of that level but as we could see they grow the business, we’ll continue to look at increasing that dividend as we move forward. 
 And again we’ll continue to look at share buyback on an opportunistic basis. We have been buying back shares over the last six months or so and again we continue to look at opportunities. If there isn’t a better opportunity through investments, we will look at share buyback as a vehicle through returning capital. 
 So now turning to our integrated strategy, I will just spend a few minutes talking about some of the advantages that our integrated strategy being across that value chain bring to the Agrium and to our shareholders. The first is around the strategic advantages. 
 We had several strategic advantages and then I will talk about the operational advantages that brings as well. So the first one is around really market intelligence. That’s a hard one to measure but being across that value chain knowing what’s going at the farm level, knowing what’s going on globally from a production level, brings a lot of value. We share that information across the organization and how both our wholesale and retail make better decision to run and operate their business as a moving forward. 
 The second one is around counter-cyclical growth, our cash flow. Because we are across that value chain, we do have balance of our cash flow. So when the market is moving down from commodity prices, our retail business freed up working capital and cash flow and ‘08 and ‘09 is a great example of that where our retail business freed up over a billion dollar of cash flow. 
 ‘09 is still our second highest cash flow generation year of the company. Nice position to be here and we are in downturn in the commodity cycle to have a good cash position, whether you are paying the dividend, whether you want to take opportunities to buyback shares or there may be an opportunity from that position standpoint to grow assets. 
 The next one from the strategic standpoint is really around acquisition and being across that value chain opens up a lot of opportunity for us, both from looking into new geography. Our retail is very capital light in terms of looking at (inaudible). For example, we recently made an acquisition in Brazil in terms of looking at expanding our retail model in to the southern Brazil market. Very low capital and it allows us to learn that market without having to make the big wholesale investment. 
 With all sources of opportunities in terms of the Viterra acquisition is a great example of that. When Viterra came into play, all the grain companies were going after Viterra and they all came to Agrium because we are the only one to cross that value chain. We could take care of the manufacturing facilities. We can also take care of the retail and basically do that one stop shop for a party that was looking at taking over Viterra and the Agrium business in total. 
 As well as even an acquisition, which is our first and we did from a retail perspective with Royster-Clark. We also get the 30% of Royster-Clark with 30% wholesale. They had manufacturing facilities. They had distribution. Some of those manufacturing facilities that have been wholesale today obviously the retail is with retail and the distribution facility, some of them are wholesale, some of them are retail, some of them are shared. So we can maximize the utilization of those facilities as well. 
 So again a tremendous amount from a strategic standpoint, then we move into the operational benefits and we have several here as well. The first one is around our production capacities and the example we used is around our potash. When the market goes long, which has been through the last at least three years, we have the ability to move product into our retail channel and keep our production facility running at a higher rate. So we have been able to actually run at higher rates in our peer groups. And I will talk a little bit about that when I give an update on our wholesale business as well. 
 And then even when the market goes tight, we have the ability to supply products to our retail to maximize their margins as well. There is also a synergy around distribution facilities. Again there is a lot of distribution that’s between that wholesale and that retail channel and we can really optimize that whether should that be a shared facility or should that be exclusive to retail or wholesale and really makes sure we’re getting the most value out of those facilities moving forward as well. 
 And then the last one from an operational standpoint is really around just the overhead cost. It cost a lot from a publicly traded company. We can leverage those corporate costs whether they are IT, board cost, CFO, CEO cost, we can leverage those across the organization as well by being across that value chain. 
 We’re moving to a little update on the business units, starting with our retail. As mentioned, we are the largest global retailer. We are servicing today over half a million farmers globally. We have over 1400 location that we are servicing through our retail chain and you could see we have a tremendous presence in U.S. where our retail started. We have now added in the [dot] for Viterra. 
 So today we have a very good market share within Western Canada with the acquisition of Viterra. We obviously had a significant presence now in Australia with the Landmark acquisition we did about two and half years ago. And then we’ve been in South America, primarily Argentina for about the last 15 years as well. 
 And if you look at our footprint today, we have a lot of diversity, both from the geography standpoint, from a product offering standpoint. We are not just providing fertilizers, we are providing seeds and chemistry and services to the grower as well and then also from across that we are servicing, we talk a lot about corn soybeans, corn probably represents less than 30% of our retail business. We are servicing everything from oilseeds to fruits and vegetables. So we have a very good diversity right across all three of those areas as well. 
 And having that side brings us a lot of advantages. We have great ability from a purchasing standpoint. We are pretty much all of the fertilizers in players and chemical suppliers, one of their largest customer which gives us a lot of buying power and we also have a tremendous distribution network to optimize how to product or move to the farmer ultimately. 
 The second piece for us in terms of -- the second piece for us has really around our proprietary products. And there is two pieces to that, we have our Loveland product, which came across in the UAP acquisition and that has been growing very rapidly, that’s our proprietary chemistry as well as nutritional. 
 And again it has been growing at about 15% to 20% a year over the last several years and we see that continue to grow for us. For example, not only the product by itself, we can move those products into Western Canada. We are now moving those products in Australia as well. 
 Underneath that private label and proprietary products, we also have seed, our own private label. And we continue to grow that business very rapidly as well overall. You look at the margins for our Loveland products. They tend to be almost twice as high as buying and reselling chemistry from a third-party as well as our seed private label in margins above 50% higher than just buying and reselling seed as well. And those are both the Loveland products and the seed that are growing at a faster pace than overall growth of those materials as well. 
 So that’s an opportunity to expand our margins moving forward. And then the last opportunity for us or advantage that we have with advanced Precision Agronomy, there has been a lot of talk about Precision Ag lately and this is an area that we -- we have actually been doing for many, many years. 
 I think over the last couple of years, it has really gained a lot of traction with farmer being very healthy and having more interest in taking best into Precision Ag, since he has the money to spend and invest as well as the farmers are becoming younger and little more receptive to some of these new technologies as well. 
 So we are touching millions of acres today through our Precision Ag, whether it’s soil sampling for the farmer, whether the plants come out of the root or ground, we do our tissue sampling of the plant and give recommendations to farmer, several areas that we are looking at from a Precision Ag. 
 And as we continue to move forward with the footprint we have, we do have a real focus on continue to optimize. We are never perfect and there is always an opportunity to improve it and we certainly play several metrics. The first metric is around our EBITDA. We set a target of $1.3 billion. In 2012, we did $950 million in EBITDA. $350 million is our growth plan by 2015 for our retail business. 
 We also have some metrics around working capital, focusing on bringing our working capital down further. As we gain to optimize our footprint, leverage the assets we have we can optimize that working capital requirement. Working capital is probably the biggest investment within our retail business for the organization. It runs at about $2.5 billion a year. And then return on capital, ensuring that we are getting good value for our assets as well. 
 So now moving to our wholesale business. Again, we have a tremendous footprint with our wholesale business. Again, we are the third largest global nitrogen producer. We have 1.2 million tonnes of phosphate in the local market in the Pacific Northwest as well as in Western Canada. And we have a wholesale product facility that we are expanding to 2 million tonnes to 3 million tonnes of productive capacity, as well as we have an extensive distribution network to buy the retailer of our shares as a second to none as well. 
 Just like our retail business, we have several competitive advantages that we enjoy within our business. And the first is around really raw material supply, gas advantage in North America and even a further advantage with majority of our production being within Western Canada. 
 We have integrated ammonia with our phosphate as well as we have sulfur advantage as well. For several raw materials and just with the footprint we have, we also have local market advantage. If you take a look at where our facilities are, where our markets are, there is very good overlap there. And I will again talk about that in a little more detail and that’s really across all our product lines, specifically with phosphate and nitrogen. And again, we already talked about the world scale production, our distribution facilities that we have as well. 
 Returning to natural gas, what we have shown here is a chart with some of the higher costs producers, particularly with Ukraine, Eastern Europe, China and where their cost position is. And really see -- and then we saw one of the current pricing is today at low 300-mark and really see a floor being created, which we really tested this summer at that lower 300 nitrogen price. And then you can see where the North American producer is as well as where we are now in Alberta. And today we have pretty much a $200 margin built in from the floor pricing that we see to what our production costs are, and so you have that advantage from a nitrogen standpoint. 
 Then I alluded to the -- in-market advantage that we have and this is just an example from a nitrogen standpoint. Import product into New Orleans, let’s say the price was $350. The price in Western Canada would be about a $100 above that or $450. And then our outbound costs are fairly limited, because we are shipping the products fairly closed to our facility -- from our facility. So we have that advantage as well. 
 When you bring those two pieces together and you take a look at the gas advantage as well as that distribution advantage, we are showing here the last three year average margin of a peer group of just over $200 and our margins of just under $250 margin. So these are realized advantages that we see within our margins with our nitrogen products. 
 And then moving to our potash, again, we talked about that we have a world-scale facility of 2 million tonnes, expanding into 3 million tonnes. We are about half way through that project today. It is scheduled to come online in the second half of next year and we will continue to progress that project. 
 If you take a look at one of the advantages that we have and I mentioned that those been across the value chain. So what we are showing here is our peer group operating rate against our limited capacity in our operating rates. So we have been able to run at 13% higher production over the last several years because we do have our retail network. 
 So, again, when the market is long, we have the ability to flex products into our retail. Again, we don’t burden the retail of that product, so they basically did not consigned it time or based on when they would have normally taken that product. So here is our flexibility moving forth. Again, just a reminder on that expansion, we do have a 14-week turnaround next year. So our production will be down around 1.1 tonnes to 1.2 million tones due to the final tie-ins through the third quarter for that expense. 
 And then moving to our phosphate, just like our nitrogen, we have several again competitive advantages. I will talk about raw materials. We have integrated ammonia supply from our nitrogen production. We also have advantage on sulfur supply as well. Most of the gas in Alberta is ours. There is tremendous or basically a disposal outlets for sulfur within Alberta and as well as down in Conda, we have an attractive supply of sulfuric acid from the Kennecott Utah Copper refinery as well. 
 So, I guess this is a good advantage as well. We have integrated rock at our Conda facility with good rock reserves at that facility. And as you are fully aware, recently starting the second half of this year we have moved to -- from our mines from Ontario for Redwater to imported rock from OCP. And we are fully on OCP rock today. That will have an impact on our margins going forward, but overall we still see being relatively competitive. 
 And in the last of the business series, let’s talk a little bit about our advanced technology. And really the cornerstone of our advanced technology is our ESN product line. So this is our polymer-coated urea. Today, we have a production capacity approaching 500,000 tonnes. With an expansion we did at our New Madrid facility in the middle of the Corn Belt where we expand that facility. The product continues to sell very well and we seek great opportunities to continue growing that product as we move forward. 
 So now moving to a little bit on the outlook going forward. And first of all, just start off talking a little bit about the longer term fundamentals. Again, we continue to see great fundamentals for this industry. This is just a slide showing the consumption of our crops around the world over the next 20 years growing significantly. What we have done is translated that into additional fertilizer required, $40 billion equivalent of revenue related to fertilizer and then on seed, the crop protection chemical is $30 billion. 
 So about $70 billion of additional revenue potential over the next 20 years, as we continue to see the sowing growth. And again, as of across that value chain, so we are not just in a position to participate in that fertilizer growth but also that seed in that chemistry growth going forward as an organization. 
 And I just have a few minutes talking about what we see kind of more shorter term here, we are pretty much through to fall season and we have seen a pretty typical fall season, both in, for the U.S. as well as Western Canada. And again, we saw very good ammonia movement in Western Canada and we had some weather challenges in parts of the U.S., but overall fairly typical fall season. 
 We are also expecting going into the spring season strong demand. We had a very good corn crop as well as good crops within Western Canada. We have seen a lot of nutrients hold on to soil as we see replenish as well. So, again, we see that strong demand going into the spring season both in our wholesale and our retail business. 
 You look at where our crop prices are today, we see compression crop prices but we still have corn at a healthy level for the farmer, who want to make the investment for example invest the fertilizer and ensuring taking care of it as fast as they grow as well. 
 Our view is that we have seen soybean margins overtake corns, so we will see a little bit of shift from soybean to corn. Our prediction is somewhere around 92 million acres to down a couple of million acres from where we were last year at 95 million acres. That is not a material impact to our retail business. 
 Again, corn isn’t all our Retail business. We have a lot of other crops that we’re supplying as well. We will see that corn again shift to probably mainly soybean as well moving forward in the next season. 
 That’s kind of our short-term outlook in terms of business. Again, strong demand right across the Board. Just a little bit on where we see the nutrients. Nitrogen we will see probably has the most upside potential, spending on how strong demand is going in the spring season. 
 We truly think about the flow today with the most upside. Phosphate, again we see right the flow today with non-integrated producer being under water in terms of their cost structure. But it really will depend on how strong demand is going into the spring season, if we see any movement on pricing. 
 Potash there is a little bit of question mark. We have, our -- that supply/demand imbalance. So we see pricing pretty much last through the next year to 18 months. But there is still some downside risk on potash side. 
 So turning with that, again, with all that tremendous growth we’ll see going forward and been across that value chain. Again we’re very well-positioned with Agrium. So, starting off with our Wholesale business unit, we have several great growth projects while we’ve talked about the potash expansion, which is the biggest part there. And these are based on 2012 margins in terms of the potential contribution and once we get through 2017. 
 Again that production will come on, start coming on through the tail end of 2014 through 2015. So it will take us about a year to 18 months to fully ramp up that production as well, with about $490 million of EBITDA contribution. 
 We also have several expansion opportunities on nitrogen. The first being our Borger facility, we’re looking at building a 600,000 ton urea plant and we already have ammonia plant, that is our small unit plant, great project for us. We’re looking at taking to our Borger very shortly for approval. 
 We are also doing a small expansion down in Argentina at our Proferti plant where we have a 50-50 joint venture of 120,000 tons of expansion. It’s a very neat project. It doesn’t require any more incremental gap, so this making our plant more efficient. 
 And there are some smaller operational efficiencies we see as well, so, again, $800 million potential EBITDA contribution based on 2012 margin in terms of growth within our Wholesale. 
 In our Retail business unit, we have equally good growth opportunities. Again, we have that target of $1.3 billion. Again, the first bar there is the Viterra acquisition. We see once it’s fully integrated and we’ve captured synergies contributing close to $100 million of EBITDA. 
 And the second bar is small and around landmark, again getting it to our original target of $100 million. (Inaudible) since probably of our most challenging or has been our most challenging Retail acquisition. But we see line of side there getting that to about up in total an incremental $25 million or $100 million contribution. 
 The biggest piece of our growth $150 million comes from organic growth. So this is the key to grow our seed business. Our Loveland product, I talked about earlier, as well as some additional efficiencies around, whether it’s looking at closing operations, doing more with our existing assets since we seems to optimize that network we have. I think this year we’ve closed another 36 facilities as we can see to optimize that network moving forward. So, again, great growth opportunity there. 
 The last bar is around Tuck-Ins, these are smaller acquisitions which are maybe one to dozen farm centers. We can see a good pipeline there and we see that part of our organic -- our growth as we going forward for Retail. So again we see great line of site to achieve that $1.2 billion run rate by the end of 2015 for our Retail business. 
 So we bring that all together, going back to one of the first live day show. We have a potential to increase our EBITDA by 40%, again based on the 2012 margin. We also have very strong financial capacity to deliver on these projects, as well as continue looking at increasing our dividend as we see to grow our earnings moving forward as well. 
 And as I mentioned, we continue to look at growth area, share buyback opportunities and we will continue to see again looking at some of this growth projects as we see to grow the organization, as well as finance capacity look at other opportunities, like acquisition as we move forward as well. 
 So just to close off, we have a fantastic track record of performance. We have tremendous long-term fundamental in this organization. And again, Agrium is uniquely positioned, not just with fertilizers but right across that value chain, take advantage of that long-term growth and see within the Ag industry. 
 With that, I will turn over to your questions.

   Hecla Mining Co. (HL) Bank of America Merrill Lynch 2013 Leveraged Finance Conference December  4, 2013  1:30 PM ET 
 Matt Fields - Bank of America Merrill Lynch 
 I'm Matt Fields. I'm the high-yield metals and mining analyst at Bank of America. I want to thank everybody for coming after that nice lunch. And I'm pleased to welcome Hecla Mining to our 2013 Leveraged Finance Conference. And with that, I'd like to introduce Jim Sabala, Senior Vice President and CFO. 
 James Sabala 
 Thank you. Thank you for everyone coming on this beautiful day. When I checked the weather at home, I think the high today was going to be 12 degrees. So I'm sure, if you're like me, you much rather be on the sunshine, but thank you for coming. We'll talk a little bit about Hecla Mining Company here first. 
 I will be making some forward-looking statements. We'll also be referring to certain terms, which are not in the Securities Exchange Commission definitions. You'll find reconciliations to those items in the appendix to your data. And I will urge you to look at our full 34 Act documents, which are on the SEC and our website. 
 First, a little bit about Hecla Mining Company or maybe little bit about myself. I grew up in the mining business. Dad and granddad were miners. I started out my first job as an underground miner at Hecla's Lucky Friday mine, which is one of the mines we'll talk about today. And I have been around the business with several precious metals companies. 
 Hecla itself has been around for 122 years. We're the longest running mining company on the New York Stock Exchange. We've been very active over the last few years. I have actually been at Hecla about five years. In the past five years, six years, we made two major acquisitions. So our portfolio now consist of three long-lived low-cost mines, mines that have stood the test of time for decades. 
 We are very unique as a mining company, because we operate only, currently and stable low-risk mining jurisdictions. 100% of our production value comes from mines in North America. And we've been growing both are gold and silver production and always strive to be very low-cost. We believe we are the lowest cost silver miner. We'll give you some information on that. 
 We're also a very, very strong financial company. Many of you are probably familiar that we did a $500 million high-yield deal in April this year that was to finance an acquisition of a gold mine in Canada. But even after that, we've maintained net debt of less than $200 million, because we have good strong cash portfolio. We keep net debt-to-EBITDA around 3.5x or less. 
 Hecla being a 120-year old mining company, for years had a large legacy liability on it. We settled that in 2011. So that's behind us. And so we're currently a very clean mining company and we're also taking a look now, those of you that follow gold and silver prices, you know that there's been a fairly significant pullback in the pricing this year. And because we're low cost and large portion of our expenditures are discretionary, we've been reducing those accordingly with the pullback in the market with the goal that we will operate at least cash flow neutral throughout the course of 2014. 
 A little bit about our asset portfolio here, you can see that the three biggest assets we have are the Greens Creek mine, which is a silver, gold, lead, zinc mine, really a world-class deposit on Admiralty Island, outside Juneau, Alaska. The Luck Friday mine in Idaho's prolific silver belt, which has been operating since the 1940s. And then the recently acquired Casa Berardi gold mine in Quebec. All three of these mines are in very good mining jurisdictions. 
 And then around that we have a number of very good exploration properties, I won't be going through all of those today. But I think we're able to offer the investor both, growth in terms of coming from our existing assets and our exploration predevelopment portfolio and value, because of the pullback both in multiples and metals prices that we've seen this year. 
 I talked about being in lower risk jurisdiction. The graph on the right shows, where the gold production comes from. 100% of it comes from either Northern Quebec or in Alaska. We're the only mining company of significance that 100% of our gold production is currently coming slowly. I guess there is one other one, but very few, that 100% of our goal production comes from North America. 
 And in terms of our silver production, Hecla is seen here, is 26% of the U.S. silver output. And again 100% of our silver output is coming from mines in Alaska and Idaho. We've had huge reserve growth. The mining company is after all about reserves, where you can see over the course of the years from 2003 to 2012, we've been able to more than triple our silver reserves and our gold ounces likewise have gone from 800,000 ounces up to 2.2 million today. 
 So a very good inventory in front of us for future production and we have a very diversified revenue. I realized this is a bond conference and you need to assess risks and in terms of our revenue stream you can see it's divided. The largest component is precious metals component, but that's equally divided nearly between silver and gold and then base metals represent a smaller part. 
 So we have a diversified stream, both in terms of the medals we produce and in terms of the geographic diversification, three world-class mines in three good jurisdictions. We also take some of that price risk out with commodities particularly with regard to our lead and zinc production. 
 We have a policy where we can hedged up to 60% of that base metal production. That's very important for us, because our byproduct credits nearly pay all of the operating cost. So we hedge or we endeavor to hedge three years of the production at a rate of 60% coverage. And we're active in the market constantly trying to achieve that, little bit below that level now, but always trying to achieve that level. That locks in our operating cost, locks in our cash flow. Currently, we've got about $300 million sold forward and that adds up to about one year's of our operating expenses. 
 We also have a phenomenon in the mining business, when you sell concentrate that you saw your product and its shift to the smelter and the product is actually finally priced about 90 days down the road, and we provisionally hedge that price exposure for all sales that have occurred, but we do no long-term hedging of our gold and silver, because we have learned that our investors want that volatility that's why they buy Hecla Mining Company, so much more aggressive on the base metal side, no long-term hedging on gold and silver. 
 And I mentioned our liquidity. We've got $338 million total liquidity, which consisted of $238 million at the end of last quarter, plus we maintain a $100 million revolving credit agreement to provide additional insurance beyond that. Again, when you look at comparable companies, very strong in that space. 
 We are most proud of is our mining heritage, and here we see the cost structure that we've had for our silver mining business, keeping in mind we just recently acquired the gold business, but the cost structure we've been able to maintain over the years, you can see a very low, most of time around $5, even a negative when base metals prices are strong. 
 We did have an uptick during the course of 2013, but that's because one of our major mines, the Lucky Friday, was down for rehabilitation in 2012, and it has been ramping up in 2013, so the unit cost is a little bit higher than we normally expect, regardless very strong margins last quarter. Silver averaged $22.22 per ounce, our cost of $7.50 gave us great margins. It's these sorts of margins that provide us additional cushion, when we see times of high volatility in metals prices. 
 And a strong financial position, I talked about our liquidity, just to give you a snapshot of our total financial position. The senior notes we issued in April are the only substantial indebtedness we have. We have no off balance sheet arrangements. Again, keeping our net debt-to-EBITDA below 3.5; total net debt-to-capitalization at 24%. 
 I talked about cash flow flexibility. The way we manage things financially at Hecla, where we try and balance financial flexibility or liquidity with growth is the start of the each year we take a look at the EBITDA we expect to generate. And that is the limiting factor in how we develop our business plan. 
 So we will take that EBITDA and we will adjust capital and exploration and predevelopment, and any other use of cash corresponding with outside of the EBITDA. So when we have very large or a very high metals prices or the EBITDA, we will modify those items upward, where in times only now where we've seen a downturn in metals price this year, we will constrict those. 
 And here you can see for example, when we look at Q3, generated $30 million of adjusted EBITDA. We used some of that for capital and exploration that we committed to this year. Some of it was changes in working capital, and then some of our hedging policy. So again, maintaining high liquidity, so that we finish the year or the quarter at $238 million. This was managed. 
 Likewise, if we look at it long-term, you can see here that over the last three years roughly, $800 million of EBITDA, $551 million which we invested back into the business was discretionary, and we had a couple of one-time items I talked about, one being the settlement of a litigation related to a legacy liability. So again, looking at our business plan, looking at our EBITDA, accomplishing goals based on the funding that's available. 
 As we go into 2014, we have had to respond to metals prices that have come down from the mid-30s down to roughly $20 today. Our response to that has been immediate, even in 2013, and so during the course of this year, every quarter when we do our forecast we take another look. 
 We maintained our programs of long logistical requirements or short implementation windows. We reduced our capital expenditures 26%. We reduced our exploration 41%. And we reduced our predevelopment expenditures 35%. This is the flexibility we have because we have long-lived low-cost mines. 
 We're continuing to grow the product of silver and gold. And during the course of 2014, it is our expectation that our final business plan will be one that our capital exploration and development expenditures will all be within the adjusted EBITDA number or the EBITDA before exploration and development. Maintaining high liquidity is a key goal for Hecla Mining Company, maintaining low cost, we'll do that in up markets and down markets. 
 Now, this is just a snapshot of our debt obligation. The only significant debt we have is the high yield we did. It was the deal we did in April, $500 million of the coupon of 6.78, eight-year tenure and a rating of B2/B. 
 Now, I'd like to talk just a little bit about the asset themselves, drill down a little bit. And I'll finish with just a quick snapshot of the silver market. But first, the Lucky Friday has been a great story. The mine started operations in the 1940s. I work there as a young man in the 70s and it continuous to continue provide good efficient production. 
 During 2012, we had the mine closed for shaft rehabilitation. We told the market, we would have the mine up and running at full production by the end of 2013, and we've been able to accomplish it. Here you can see how we ramped up backup production through the course of this year. Large mines are in essence fixed cost operations for the most part, so you've seen the cash cost for production as we ramped up, continue to come back down. We produced 816,000 ounces of sliver in the first nine months. 
 We have reached our historical design throughput rate of 900 tons per day in September, and we would expect to produce alike amount in fourth quarter to bring our total production to 1.6 million ounces. We expect the cash cost to reach $9.50 in December, which is very close to its historical run rate. 
 So this has been a successful restart of a great historic mine. We're really looking forward to 2014, when Lucky Friday will be at full production for the whole year. We're providing the operating cash flow, and we'll also be providing the EBITDA for purposes of our credit statistics, so very successful story. 
 Here is another snapshot of the ramp up. The red line is the 900 tons per day we want to achieve and you can see early in the fourth quarter that mine was up and running. We put this in here, because one of the frequent questions I get is, how are things going at Lucky Friday? Is Lucky Friday going to achieve its goals? And we think this demonstrates, as miners like to say, we're putting rock in the box, that's what we would expect for all of 2014. 
 A little snapshot of the Lucky Friday, and why we like the Lucky Friday so much. It's called unlocking value at depth. In this particular slide, you will see a lot of colors on there and the harder the color, as in yellow and red, the higher the quality of the ore reserve. And you can see the huge amounts of red that we have in the ore, which we're getting ready to access for the new shaft, which is the vertical line on the right hand side of the chart. 
 And this is a shaft that we started a couple of years ago. We would expect to complete it during the course of 2016 and be able to get down to some of that tremendous material that you see down here. Not only is the ore body richer, it runs about 30% to 50% higher grade, but it's a wider ore body, so we can be much more productive when we extract it. So we expect the Lucky Friday in 2017 to increase its production from 3 million ounces of silver a year to 5 million ounces of silver. 
 We also expect the corresponding lead and zinc quantities to go up, because their grades also increase. The mine will be productive, because the ore body is wide, so we would expect cash cost to come down and our production levels at the Lucky Friday to go from 3 million to 5 million ounces a year. Another very important fact is, this is not a new mine, this is technology and this is operations which we've had been running for decades, so we feel the risk is extremely low of surprises in unlocking that value. 
 The Greens Creek, up in Alaska, also a very consistent performer, produced 1.8 million ounces last quarter. Its normal run rate is between 6 million and 7 million ounces, so you can see this year it's been operating at the high-end of the spectrum. It's been knocking the cover off the ball. 
 Cash costs have been around $5, so very consistent margins to come out of Greens Creek. 5.6 million ounces in the first three months, and I think it's safe to say, it will achieve 7 million ounces for the year. We also reached a major permitting hurdle there as that we have one final tailings dam that construct at Greens Creek, which is the life of mine, and the U.S. Forest Service issued the record of decision for that facility just recently here. 
 Again, Greens Creek, the world-class mine. Past 26 years, $3 billion in revenue, free cash flow of nearly $1 billion. We would expect the next 10 years to be correspondingly strong, because as you can see, it created those types of financial returns in times when metals prices as depicted by the silver color line were in the doldrums for some time. 
 Both of our mines are high-quality large mines relative to the industry as a total. Here is the chart, where we have silver grade, the size of silver reserves, and you can see the two highlighted areas, both of our mines are very high-grade with long mine lives. Nothing beats grade in the mining business. High grade means your revenue is higher for a given amount of work. And so these two mines, year-in and year-out are consistent performers. 
 Now a little bit about our mine, which we acquired in Casa Berardi. Casa Berardi was controlled, was owned by a company called Aurizon gold mine. It is a company that we had followed for some period of time, since 2006, for the reason that the skills used to work at Casa Berardi are identical to what we use in Greens Creek and Lucky Friday. 
 This is a large underground mine with the same type of metallurgical processing, the same type of extraction techniques, so we know it well. It's in a safe jurisdiction. It's in Quebec, Canada. When you come out of the airport, the first thing you see in front of the airport is a statue of miner there. So these are the jurisdictions we like because the people want you to be there. They're trained. We've got an excellent workforce. 
 Casa Berardi or the Aurizon gold mines, I should say, became the subject of an unsolicited takeover because their share price had fallen. And we had known them well. We've had discussions as late as December of 2012 about the possibility of putting the two mines together. And at that time Casa Berardi had experienced some operating difficulties. We had our Lucky Friday mine coming up. Both companies thought it best that we let those things settle down before we engaged in detailed discussions. Another company stuck its nose in the middle of it, so we had the opportunity, and we went in and bought that. 
 Casa Berardi, we're expecting production to increase. When we first brought the property, it syndicated one of the problems they have as operational, and it was a lack of adequate development. Here we can see the first month we bought it is an 8,000 ounce run rate, which was for the one month. 23,000 ounces in the quarter and we expect 32,000 ounces this year. 
 We have parachuted a team of our experts from Hecla into Casa Berardi, who is working jointly on a very cooperative basis with Casa Berardi people and consequently we're expecting the improvement that we see, and we're expecting cash costs to come down there. They like the Lucky Friday are also constructing shaft, deepening an existing shaft. They're also constructing a paste fill facility and we would expect efficiencies to come from that in the future and efficiencies usually translate into lower cash cost. 
 The real reason we bought Casa Berardi is what the future holds. Two areas we're real excited about. Down here, below the existing area that they have been mining, we're doing exploration there and we're looking at the potential of adding reserves, and all of this in area between historic mining, which had occurred over here and more recent mining, which had occurred over here. We know there are mineral occurrences along the surface here. And so we will be developing an exploration program to look to expand those reserves. 
 Having said that, even today without expansion, you can see that we have a total of 3 million ounces of reserves in front of us or roughly 20 years of production, so we think Casa Berardi over time will prove to be a very good acquisition for Hecla Mining Company, leveraging our existing skills in a safe jurisdiction with a long life. Here is the same tons in grade chart and you can see Casa Berardi compared to several of the other large mines in Canada. 
 Now, a little bit about 2013 and how we expect to finish up the year. Silver production, we started out the year, we expected production of 8 million to 9 million ounces. It's important to us that we meet our guidance, and I am pleased to say, we will be at the high end of that range; Greens Creek of 7 million ounces; Lucky Friday at 1.6 million ounces. Total cash cost of $6.5, so even with the price pull back, if you look at a $20 silver price and an operating cost of $6.5, that's a pretty good business. 
 We expect gold production from Casa Berardi to achieve 62,000 ounces this year. Continued improvement over the course of the year, since we acquired it at a cash cost of around $950. As indicated during the course of the year, we made dramatic reductions in some discretionary costs and we'd expect to finish the year with a $163 million in CapEx; exploration of $21 million and predevelopment of $14 million. 
 And we expect to finish the year with a financial position with excess of $200 million in cash -- or $200 million in cash, I'm sorry, and $100 million undrawn revolving credit agreement. Strong silver reserve growth at the end of the year, we're expecting our reserves to go up. 
 Now, little bit about the silver market in particular. I think most people follow the gold market, but I'd like to talk about silver. One of the reasons the silver market we think has been so robust over the year is because a lot of uses for silver did not exist 10 years ago. As a matter of fact, to date myself, in the early 80s the silver market was about 400 million ounces, of which half the demand was photography. 
 Today the silver market is right at a 1 billion ounces and photography is only 8% because the advent of digital technology. So while the primary use of silver has all, but evaporated, the market has grown up to 1 billion ounces. Why? It's because things like iPhones, iPads, electronic use that we've all seen explode. 
 Silver has the highest electrical conductivity of all the metals, so it is very efficient in high-end applications 80% more conductive than aluminum, 50% more conductive than gold, 6% more conductive than copper, but more important is the metal is much stronger than the soft metal life copper, so it's very effective on high-end electronic components. 
 Higher superior thermal conductivity, transfers heat very efficiently, so in these uses where heat is the enemy, it is very efficient. And highest reflectivity, so it has great use in all kinds of electrical circuits, manufacturing, such as bearing surfaces, solar panels, it's an antibacterial, so the medical use for stents, band-aids, and a lot of things for silver, we've seen dramatic growth in all those. One of the real fun ones now is the RFID chips and all of those are used to things like Wal-Mart and that they automatically scan, they divert packages, very efficient use of silver. 
 I was at a mining conference in October a year ago and someone pointed out to me that they had put an RFID in my badge, so that they could track me to see, which conferences I went to, who I met with, so they can get feedback on how they structured it. I was telling a number of investors that met with me about that and I saw a lot of people tearing their badges up right after that, because they didn't like that idea of big brother. But it's very efficient in tracking, it's a new use. And so we're excided to see it in the silver business. 
 The other thing that's happening is when we talk about the products, and these products that I just mentioned are high-end products. We've had a whole part of the world, over the last five to 10 years it's been developing, the India's, the China's, the Brazil's of the world, and as their affluence grows, their GDP goes up, they consume more silver. 
 If we take a look at this particular example here, we can see Japan in 1990 consumed about 0.40 of an ounce of silver per capita, that had increased to nearly 0.70 in 2010, so growth both in terms of applications and then growth in terms of larger markets for people with their products. 
 So when I sum up Hecla, Hecla is all about this chart; number one, three high-quality long-lived operation; two, operating in low political risk jurisdictions. We're not in Argentina, we're not in Peru, we're not in some of those places. Secure multiple metal streams, not only we're diversified by geographic location, but we're also diversified among for our metals, and we hedge a large portion of that to take out the risks of the base metals. 
 Established workforce in all the jurisdictions that we work; a strong commitment to safety; a very strong financial position, which we intend to maintain, both in terms of good metals prices and lower metals prices; high cash margins because of the efficiency of our mines, which gives us the cash flow flexibility to react to changes in the metals price. 
 So that's the end of my prepared comments, and I'd be pleased to respond to any questions, if I can.

   CA, Inc. (CA) Credit Suisse Technology Conference Call December  4, 2013  1:00 PM ET 
 Unidentified Analyst 
 We’ll have people circle in here but we will get rolling on this. So Mike thanks for coming down to Arizona here and like I’ve been saying it’s exactly brought you that really make this conference special. So, that was a busy time of the year so appreciate you coming down. The – I guess its two things kick start, just to wind a bit the last quarter obviously you guys had pretty fantastic margins that you put up as a result of some of the restructuring, some of the revenue in the mix. But maybe take us through where you are in terms of just reallocation resource and restructuring and sort of the margins and then we’ll get into the go-to market size and sales. 
 Mike Gregoire - Chief Executive Officer 
 Yeah the – we’ve done a lot of change in the last year in the company. We took $100 million of sales. We repurpose that, some of that to marketing and as you know the spend it’s easier to take the cost out and you want to be very thoughtful on how you spend the money going forward. So one of the things that we have in our company is we have a real big almost an impedance mismatch between what the company does and the perception of the company and part of fixing that is going to take some dollars to get the right marketing and the right marketing people and the right programs and culturally in the company as well. So we took expense so faster than we were able to spend so it’s a part of the margin improvement. 
 And then secondly as we made a lot of changes in developments. We went from 80 development centers down to 40 and really focused our development on six geographic locations and they would be where you would suspect them to be where the highest number of cloud architects and cloud organic engineering is. So we opened up our big office in Silicon Valley. We have 500 engineers in there and they are working on some of the net new innovation that we are driving, we are in Houston, Texas, a great engineering place. 
 Traditionally Framingham down the Boston corridor has been a great place for engineers especially East Coast engineers, we’ve got a very substantial development shop in Long Island where the company has been for an awful long time. And then we have Prague in Europe has been a great place for getting Linux-based Java capable engineers and hardly enough most of those engineers work on mainframe oriented products. So a lot of change in development, starting to make the changes in marketing and those will be trickled into thoughtful changes into the sales force going into Q4, into 2015. 
 Unidentified Analyst 
 So let’s transition into the sales force I know that’s one of the focus points that you’ve had since you’ve taken over sort of where are we and I guess through the evolution or revolution to create the CA sales force and just go-to market strategy. 
 Mike Gregoire - Chief Executive Officer 
 No, I think it’s almost the tale of two cities. There are things that the company does extraordinarily well in the sales force and there are things where I think there is obvious room for improvement. Execution across the Board in the whole company I don't think we’re operating where any of us would be happy. And if you ask any of my direct reports if they didn’t seal that there is opportunity for improvement across the company I think they’d be very open and vocal about saying that now sometimes to go make those changes. On the sales force I really break it up into two distinct areas. We have large sophisticated multi-year relationships with the Fortune 500 and that model I think works very well. 
 There are opportunities for expense improvement in that area, but as far as are we a trusted provider, do we sell the way that those companies want to buy. At the end of the day you are dealing with a black-belt procurement shop and you are dissociated with the economic user and your technology in the back end of this sale’s process. And I think we do a very good job of managing ELAs and working with those large sophisticated customers. Now that model I don’t think works very well in the territory model and (indiscernible) doesn’t work well the net new and the beauty of their cloud is to democratize technology. 
 So there was a time like even five years ago 300 to $2 billion Company which is not a small company and they’re going to have international operations. They are going to be sophisticated users of technology. They could never afford some of the systems that we had, the level of complexity, the infrastructure required to run those systems. Fast-forward to where we are today they absolutely come, the cost of computing has gone significantly down and we have not cracked a nut on this across all of our portfolio but we definitely are starting to see it happen as we are taking very complex solutions and making them easier to use, easier to install and easier to run. So we have seven fast applications today and those applications shouldn’t be limited to just the biggest companies in the world. 
 There is absolutely no reason technically why they can’t be sold and run in – to a 300 to $2 billion market and that’s not something that we have a lot of muscle in memory in doing. Our lead generation process is unsophisticated for doing that. I think some of the talent we have in the company can be repurposed and the expense that we take in these large transactions needs to be rationalized so we have enough capital that we’ll spend on these net new and that’s a global basis. Furthermore I think that’s the way people want to buy. And to the extent that we get good at that I think it offers opportunities for growth and quite frankly I just don’t see the world not evolving to a try and buy prove to me that it works at a certain subset and then I’ll expand the relationship and we have to get extraordinarily comfortable and extraordinarily efficient and we have to kick up the velocity on being able to do that. 
 So those are kinds of deals that we are rolling out in the sales force. We’ve been rolling them out pretty much every quarter at a pace at the sales force and our customers understand. So from the outside looking in if you look at it every quarter there has been a change into the sales force but what I’m trying not to be disruptive to our customers and I want to bring the sales force along with the thinking where they also understand why it’s good for them, why is it good for CA and most importantly why is it good for customers. And to the extent we win those arguments I think we got the stability that we are looking for coupled with the opportunity for improved efficiency and growth.

 Couple of more questions on like – on the go-to market I mean one thing historically before you got that CA struggled with sort of selling outside of the renewal process. I remember some the previous manager say well don’t worry, the new products that’s going to be okay but we got the renewal base coming next year and then we can sell the product. How do you break that I won’t say cycle but how do you break the mentality I guess? 
 Mike Gregoire - Chief Executive Officer 
 Well focus and accountability. If we have – it’s a different horses for different courses and I don’t believe that your previous statement has turned out to be true. I think that hanging around waiting for renewal to happen two things happen. Number one it is an event and that’s an event that can be used for good and for bad by us and by the customer but just understand that it’s a event, it’s going to happen. I think that conversation needs to happen a lot earlier and just because you are having that conversation a lot earlier doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be selling in the meantime. And this whole notion that we’re going to wait until the renewal comes and try to compress all of that selling into a short period of time I think leads a bad taste of customer’s mouth, I think it is highly risky for us as a company and I think we give away a lot of economics on net new innovation in the dying hours of a very complex renewal. 
 And I think that, that’s a process that we are dealing with and I also think that the amount of sales acumen required to sell MIPS is relatively low and you should get paid relatively low to nothing to be able to do that. I think that the ability to hold the line on the value of net new highly differentiated products are not jamming them into in ELA needs to be addressed and that could be addressed by process, it can be addressed by trainee, and we have to help our customers understand that, that’s not something that we’re super-excited to go ahead and do if the economics on the other part of the transaction aren’t as robust as they need to be. And this is just being thoughtful applying critical thinking and accountability. I also think there is a time that should be doing renewals and there is a team that should be selling net new products and to the extent that we can differentiate those as best we can. 
 I think we get the focus that we’re looking for and I also think it’s a different talent base that does want to compare to the other, it’s a different cost structure. Now the upper end of the market I think you are not going to get away from the way that CA traditionally does that today. If you think you’re going to go sell to one of the biggest customers we have that has a $80 million a year relationship with us. And their procurement team is not going to bring the renewal the net new products, the customer support, and implementation into the conversation that’s just naïve thinking and to try to have that not focused around a individual that controls that destiny and not pay them appropriately for that transaction I think you are steering the pot for no reason because at the end of the day you have to have a dance partner, that dance partner wants to have that conversation with all of those pieces. We just have to be thoughtful about how many customers really belong in that camp, in that model I can tell you does not work well for net new. 
 Unidentified Analyst 
 Yeah and the other go-to market we talk about earlier that was in the channel. Jay historically sort of add up the hot and cold relationship with the channel. How do you view that sort of the option in the channel today? 
 Mike Gregoire - Chief Executive Officer 
 Well two ways first of all you only get the behavior that you tolerate and that works both ways. If we – what I’ve seen in the past we have a tough quarter and we have a customer or a partner that’s not on our schedule and we want to get a transaction done. We’ve probably been a little bit more aggressive than we need it to be and we took that transaction and got it done on our timeframe. And that is going to be massively irritating to a partner. 
 The word partnership and that kind of behavior are almost regionally exclusive. So I look upon that is a failure in leadership in our part. If we have partners that don't understand our needs and our timeframes. That has to be addressed but it is in the context of partnership. Coupled with that the other side is we can’t have people that say their partners and they are not showing preference to our solutions and what we want to engage with that particular customer. So I would rather have fewer good partners than have a broad set of what we’re going to shake hands and grab a bottle of wine a mistake once a quarter and have all these meetings that amount to nothing, 
 I would rather have deep relationships where they are financially obligated and investing in CA and we honor that agreement and we’re going to help them get what they want but it’s usually professional services. We are not in the professional services business per se. We’re in the professional services business to preserve our brand and to make sure that we – that customers go live on our applications as quickly as they possibly can. And as long as everybody stays in the right swim lanes and we intermittently understand each other’s needs I think we can have a much better robust relationship with these partners. 
 And then there is a whole new category of partners that I think were uniquely capable of doing meaningful work with and that’s in the whole concept of MSP. And the beauty of moving our applications to the cloud is we are never, we are not equipped to go sell our software to a company that has 200 employees or 500 employees in our cost of sales would be a range to do that. But when we are working with some of our MSP providers they do that all day everyday and with the multi-tenant application running in their datacenter either private labeled or with our brand that’s a whole net new customer base that we have never had and nor do we have any go-to market plan or rational strategy to get to you. So I’m extremely attracted to the MSP play and that it gets us to a whole net new set of customers we never had. 
 Now does it come without risk, our brand. I want to make sure especially being in a cloud guidance or in a cloud company for a long time is when and if there is never a security breach or a problem with processing I can guarantee it’s not going to be the MSP that’s in the front-page of the Wall Street Journal it’s going to be us. So I have some very specific technical requirements of these MSPs and standards in which they have to and hear to if they’re going to run our solutions and be able to sell. So I think we’re getting there, but the tone is deeper relationships, honorable relationships and investment on both of our parts. And I think if we do that and are very transparent and pick good partners. And they pick us I think we can add more growth and it’s something we have traditionally not been great at and we have a whole team that’s committed and focused to making that happen. 
 Unidentified Analyst 
 Got it. Trying to get a little bit to the product side. Let’s kick off first with you, one of the big margins that this was obviously mainframe. When you laid out you go through long term growth. How do we think about sort of mainframe and lead through the overall sort of growth and also profitability metrics for CA? 
 Mike Gregoire - Chief Executive Officer 
 Sure. Can I take it up just the level on the mainframe. 
 Unidentified Analyst 
 Sure. 
 Mike Gregoire - Chief Executive Officer 
 So the mainframe is not as well understood it is I think it should be and I think that’s on us to make people understand it. Being new to the company I had a completely different view of the mainframe. Number one is it’s where our customer relationships emanate from. And my whole technical career is if you do a good job on what you said you were going to do the probability that someone would trust you to do the next thing is very high. So the mainframe first of all has to be rock solid. It has to be rock solid for two reasons. First of all its running machine critical applications and we just saw that last weekend Black Friday Cyber Monday there is more transactions run on mainframes and you could possibly imagine and our - the throughput through our systems was extraordinary. 
 Everyone that uses those systems they have to be confident supremely confident that those systems are going to run all day everyday and it is technology. When there is a bump in the night they want to make sure when they call somebody did they have expertise local whether that be in the UK, whether that be in China, whether that be in Australia, whether that be in Germany or France, they’re not going to want, they don’t want people to understand their environment and understand their processing speak their language and the cost structure also comes into play. 
 Taking consultants from Australia dropping them into China with Australian professional services cost that doesn’t work very well. So you have to make these investments and my thought on the mainframe is make sure that its rock solid and it has the right kind of support structure that when you’re doing the maintenance you can point to it and say hey these are the kind of services we are getting with your maintenance agreement and there is definitely value. 
 Number two is just because the platform is considered to be legacy it doesn’t mean there is lack of innovation that should happen there. We have to invest in the mainframe and help modernize the mainframe and I think we’re the only company other than IBM that’s still investing in the mainframe. If you just take a look at the last quarter we took a very old antiquated tape management system and instead of putting the data from IMS and DB2 on to tape we put it into Amazon AWS, same user interface, same algorithm, but just modernizing the platform so that the operations people don’t have to do anything different, but now you take away all the complexity of physically loading tapes and unloading tapes that happens all day everyday around the world with the mainframe, there is still a lot of tape backups and tape redundancy. But having that go over a wide area network highly secure we are paying a penny a terabyte that’s the way of helping modernize the mainframe. 
 When you look at the Chorus product on the mainframe I could put you in front of Chorus and you could go over the index at DB2 database you probably get it wrong and drive a mainframe into complete submission with a full table scan, but you’re using a graphical user interface point and click on something that use to be on a 32, 70 monitor with our case set of commands that if you got any one of them wrong you’re going to hamper a productivity and you’re going to hurt production. Automating that giving a modern user interface streamlines the operations and brings it into a more modern architecture and customers like that and that’s the mainframe and we have to continue to do that. 
 And if we do a good job on that they trust us and distribute it and they’re going to trust us in the cloud. So I knew the mainframe is a core to the company, its core to the company’s culture and it is a great economic engine for the company as well because it does generate, it is a high margin business, but we’re using those margin some to pass it on to shareholders with a 36% operating margin business is blended which is a great software margin. And then how smart are we in taking that cash flow and taking the rest of the margin investing into areas for growth. And that’s traditionally been the knock on CA is you do a great job on this mainframe, it seems to me that you’re understanding it well which is then $660 million on R&amp;D where is the growth and that is something that I take a great deal of passion to try to make it happen. But it is not an easy task and it doesn’t happen overnight but I feel we’re clearly making progress. 
 Unidentified Analyst 
 Let’s switch gears to growth and especially the enterprise business first the mainframe. Enterprise or distributing systems managements really kind of going through that, you need timeframe where you’ve got BMC going private, the disruption they’re seeing the emergence of the service now to me were like IBM and HP trying to figure out what they’re going to be doing and CA how do you view yourself compatibly against sort of these traditional big fours, many of the VMware, many of the new guys, the service (inaudible). Where is the exit end - how do you differentiate yourself versus? 
 Mike Gregoire - Chief Executive Officer 
 Sure. Well, we do three things, right. And we do three things in three different platforms. We do security. We do infrastructure management. And we do application management. We do that on the mainframe. We do that distributed doing it in the cloud. And it’s all up for graphs. It is a foot raise. This is about innovation, execution and speed. The company that is able to master those three things, I think is going to be the more dominant player. And when I take a look at our company, we have all of the makings to be able to do that. It does take some time. It has different set of problems. When you take a look at our traditional competitors, I am less worried about them, just because the company has been competing against them for 30 years. And they have their own set of issues that are very similar to ours and they are not easy to solve. Most of them are much bigger than us and the issues are more entrenched. And then you take a look at some of the other companies you have mentioned that are well-funded VCs that are either not public or just public. And I was one of those companies. And that set of problem is not a walk in the park either. In order for them to keep up with their growth, they are going to have to do acquisitions. Acquisitions are very tricky, especially for young companies. 
 Number two is international expansion. International expansion is very expensive. It’s operationally difficult. A lot of the processes that you build that made you very successful in North America do not translate very well when you step outside of the North American English – for the English speaking borders, you have to really think through a lot of that. So there is no free lunch for anybody here. Growth is hard business for small well-funded companies. It’s hard for large cap companies, but everybody has different strengths. I think at a small cap company their strength is they don’t know better and they have speed. Large cap company, they have the ability to acquire any talent that they want. They have infrastructure in place that they can leverage and they usually have very stable good balance sheets. So you want to play to your strengths and you want to make sure you are adequately aware of areas where you don’t have the – you don’t have the perceived ability to compete with some of the smaller players. 
 And for us, it’s speed. I would like to see us move much faster. I talk to the team about this all the time. And to the extent that we do things that slow us down, I want to stop, pause and go fix that, because we are for the long-haul we want to build lots of organic products. And to the extent that we can make the company run faster, stronger, I think puts us in a situation where we compete with some of the well-funded VCs. And if we do that coupled with using the strengths of our balance sheet in our international breadth and depth, we have to step up against our traditional competitors and trying to triangulate all that into a common management system, I think puts us in a situation where we can be one of the premier players in the security infrastructure management application space. 
 Unidentified Analyst 
 The last couple of minutes here, I mean, you have got a lot in your place. And so I mean, what are you sort of when you think of the next 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, how do you sort of prioritize in which you are probably signing to go-to-market, getting the R&amp;D guys, I think cloud person embrace that partners, how do you prioritize sort of near and medium term? 
 Mike Gregoire - Chief Executive Officer 
 At the highest level, I use three words and I tend to use just a lot of the company, because it’s a rally in cry. Innovation, execution and speed, those sound like pie in the sky words, but I really believe those are the three themes that we need to be thinking about in everything we do. Now, what does that translate into? If I was to pick the three things, it’s kind of like you have multiple children, you can’t pick the three in the three. And they all behave differently. We have to – I just can’t see us slowing down the momentum we have built on the product side. We have seven products that are SaaS oriented today. We have nine mobile interfaces. We are first and foremost in a number of product categories like security, product and portfolio management. I think we got a multi-year head start in the whole concept of DevOps. 
 And mobility is table stakes nowadays, but we have got the brand permission to take mobility to the next level and I want to do that organically. So on the product side, I don’t want to give up anything on the product side. From a marketing perspective we are very unsophisticated and we are changing that quickly. It comes from product marketing to help marketing interfaces with sales and to how our marketing interfaces with the rest of the world and what is the image of CA. I think our capability compared to the opinion, there is a pretty big gulf there that needs to get rationalized. I don’t think that happens overnight, but that’s something that has to happen. 
 Now, if you do those two things and you are constantly pushing on that all day everyday, it’s going to translate into the sales model, because at the end of the day, I believe that customers are going to want to try and buy. So when you take a look at a product that we put out there, Nimsoft Monitor Snap, you go to our website and go to the investor website. It’s right up there. You download it. It takes less time than any other product on the market. It’s got a highly graphical user interface. It works right off to bed. I have installed it myself. It’s easy to use. 
 And it’s free for up to 30 devices and we can monitor that and drive that right into our lead generation system. So that when a customer is using it, they have got the 30 devices and then you start think about deploying an expensive sales force rather than having expensive sales force trying to cold call somebody that can’t even touch, feel or smell the product. I think that when you can touch, feel and smell our products we have a much better ratio of trying, getting to buying and expanding the relationship. But I don’t see that being limited to just infrastructure component. I think that’s across the board, whether the application infrastructure security. We have much more sophisticated buyers. They are more discerning. Relationships are still important, but even if you have a great relationship, the product got to stand on its own to receive. And the only way to do that is get people to use it and see it.

   Caterpillar, Inc. (CAT) Credit Suisse 2013 Industrials Conference December  4, 2013  1:15 PM ET 
 Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse 
 Hi, good afternoon, everyone. So up next we have Caterpillar. Next to me right here we have Mike DeWalt who everyone knows he's now Vice President of Strategic Services. We have Jim Umpleby who is the Group President of Power Systems, and then Rich Moore is all the way at the end who heads the Investor Relations Group. So I think before we get started I just wanted to give Jim the opportunity to give an overview of sort of what he does the power systems business and what he does, and then we’ll just open it up to Q&amp;A. Thank you, Jim. 
 Mike DeWalt 
 Very good. All right, thank you, Jamie. Well, good afternoon, good to be with you today. Just very briefly, as you may know, Caterpillar is separated in the three main segments. Construction Industries, which is the traditional kind of construction equipment you normally think of with Caterpillar; Resource Industries, which is primarily mining, and Energy and Power Systems and that is the area that I'm responsible for. 
 Last year, our sales were about $21 billion and we have four primary segments, the largest being oil and gas, which represents about 40% of our sales; electric power is about 30%; transportation is 20%, transportation is consist of both rail and marine; and industrial, which is small engine sold to industrial users, is about 10%. And so as we look forward to this year we’ve said that our sales will be down about 5% compared to the peak that we achieved in 2012. So, again, it’s a very high level overview and we’re pleased to entertain any questions you might have.

   New York &amp; (NWY) Q3 2013 Earnings Call December  4, 2013  4:30 PM ET 
 Operator 
 Good day, and welcome to the New York &amp; Company Third Quarter 2013 Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Suzanne Rosenberg, Director of Investor Relations at New York &amp; Company. Please go ahead, ma'am. 
 Suzanne Rosenberg 
 Thank you. Good afternoon. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call, either as part of our prepared remarks or in response to your questions, may contain forward-looking statements that are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provision in the Private Securities and Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the company's documents filed with the SEC, including the company's fiscal year 2012 Form 10-K. 
 On the call with me today is Greg Scott, Chief Executive Officer; Laura Weil, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Sheamus Toal, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. For today's call, Greg will review our third quarter results and discuss the progress we've made on our strategic initiatives. Sheamus will then review our financial results in more detail and provide you with our near-term financial outlook. Following our prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions. 
 With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Greg. 
 Gregory J. Scott 
 Thank you, Suzanne. Good afternoon, everyone. During the third quarter, we continued to improve our performance and delivered comp store sales increases in each channel of our business and the seventh consecutive quarter of improved operating performance versus the respective prior year period. We believe that our consistent progress demonstrates that our keys to success are having a positive impact on our business. 
 While we are pleased with our product and marketing initiatives, including the extremely successful launch of our partnership with Eva Mendes, we did experience softer traffic patterns than planned in the quarter. Our growth businesses, Outlets and eCommerce, also continue to contribute strongly to our performance and to our long-term growth potential. 
 In total for the third quarter, comp store sales increased 3%, following a comp increase of 0.7% last year. We achieved our highest maintained markup rate since fiscal year 2006, driven by improved product cost and sourcing efficiencies. As a result, gross margin expanded to 28%. SG&amp;A expenses continue to be well controlled. Operating loss narrowed to $3.1 million, which marked our seventh consecutive quarter of improved operating performance versus the respective prior year period. 
 Our comp sales increase in the third quarter was driven by the strength of our company's core equity, the important pants and denim category. We kicked off the third quarter with our signature pant and denim event in August, where we saw a great strength in our core wear-to-work pant assortment, driven by the strong demand for our signature 7th Avenue Pant. We also saw strong performance in denim driven by our leggings silhouette. Casual sweaters and outerwear were also strong performers in the third quarter, and this trend has continued in the fourth quarter. However, these strengths were offset by softness in our wear-to-work top and dress assortments in September and October. 
 At the same time, in September, we launched our Eva Mendes Collection, which is the success for the company and exceeded our expectations from both the business and brand perspective. Not only did our existing customers respond strongly to the collection, we also attracted new customers into our brand. The initial launch of this business was relatively small. However, due to the strong response to the Eva Mendes Collection, we are expanding it and bringing in the added assortment to all of our stores in spring of 2014. Importantly, the marketing and publicity around this launch significantly increased our company's brand exposure as we capitalized on press opportunities with TV and social media, along with magazine partnerships. In fact, total press surrounding the launch delivered an amazing 938 million impressions. While overall traffic continues to be challenging, we did see an improvement in traffic trends in both our stores and our eCommerce sites during September, coinciding with the launch of the Eva Mendes Collection. 
 Our growth channels, eCommerce and Outlet, continue to drive an increasing portion of our overall business. During the third quarter, eCommerce represented approximately 10% of our business. The Eva Mendes Collection was a strong traffic driver to our eCommerce site, with many items selling out within the first week of the launch. We also experienced double-digit growth in AUR from last year. Traffic to our site continues to grow with record levels of unique visitors. In early 2014, we look forward to the relaunch and replatform of our eCommerce site, including mobile commerce. Our new site will feature fresh new designs, enhanced navigation and single-page checkout to allow for an easier customer experience. 
 Outlets continue to be a highly productive and profitable channel for the company, with positive comp and increases in ADS, AUR and conversion. During the quarter, Outlets represented approximately 9% of total sales. Outlet exclusive merchandise now represents approximately 70% of Outlet sales versus 40% last year, and we remain focused on driving this portion of the Outlet business. At quarter end, we operated 50 outlet stores, opening 5 new locations during the third quarter. We will end the year with 51 outlets in operation, and we remain confident in our long-term opportunity to operate over 75 outlets nationwide. 
 Our new store openings are focused on our Outlet channel. However, we continue to remodel and downsize New York &amp; Company locations where it is appropriate. In the third quarter, we completed 2 remodels, and we are particularly excited about the remodel of our store in the Columbia Mall in Maryland, which showcases our first store of the future. As you may recall, this new design truly reflects the new New York &amp; Company brand. Its layout allows us to highlight our sub-brands, its 7th Avenue Suiting Collection, Eva Mendes, denim and our Love NY&amp;C Collection. Already, this store has significantly outperformed our expectations, and we are encouraged by its success. We look forward to incorporating different elements of this new design into our remodels and new stores as we move forward. 
 As we enter the final quarter of the year, we experience a solid start to the holiday season driven by our well-planned Thursday/Black Friday event and Cyber Monday. In our core New York &amp; Company stores, we were especially pleased that during the Thursday/Black Friday time period, we generated positive mid-single-digit comp store sales, and we delivered the highest average store volume in the history of the company. We were also pleased to deliver margin improvement versus the prior year during this time period. 
 While it's still early in the quarter, we believe we have the right initiatives in place to continue our progress in the final quarter of the year. The positive performance of our Eva Mendes Collection has continued and is highlighted in our December fashion book, which showcases our holiday collection. We also expect our new promotion leading up to Christmas called The Wish List, 12 Days, 12 Deals [ph] will provide a strong traffic driver for us. Overall, we have strong strategies in place, and we are poised to win at holidays during this all-important season. 
 And now I would like to turn call over to Sheamus to review our financials and guidance in more detail. 
 Sheamus G. Toal 
 Thank you, Greg. Good afternoon, everyone. Net sales for the third quarter of fiscal year 2013 decreased by 0.7% to $217.6 million as compared to $219.3 million for the prior year, reflecting our reduced store count, partially offset by increases in comparable store sales. Total company comparable store sales for the third quarter of fiscal year 2013 increased by 3%, and importantly, included positive comparable store sales results across all 3 channels of our business. In the comparable store sales base, average dollar sale per transaction increased by 2.9%, and the number of transactions per average store increased by 0.1%. 
 Gross profit for the third quarter increased to $61 million or 28% of net sales as compared to $60.9 million or 27.8% of net sales last year. This increase was driven by improved product cost combined with reductions in buying and occupancy expenses. This resulted in the company's highest gross margin performance in the third quarter since 2007. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses were very well controlled and tightly managed, reflecting decreases to plan in marketing, store expenses and variable compensation costs. Total SG&amp;A expenses decreased to $64.1 million or 29.4% of net sales despite investments in marketing due to the launch of Eva Mendes partnership and investments in our eCommerce and Outlet businesses. 
 Operating loss for the third quarter was $3.1 million, reflecting an improvement from the prior year's third quarter operating loss of $3.8 million. Net loss for the third quarter was $3.4 million or $0.05 per diluted share. This compares to the prior year net loss of $3.8 million or $0.06 per diluted share. 
 Moving to our quarter-end balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $37.4 million in cash compared to $23.5 million at the end of last year's third quarter, reflecting the combination of improved operating results, as well as the benefit from the extension of vendor payment terms. 
 Total quarter-end inventory at cost was in line with the company's expectations, reflecting an increase of 5.9% as compared to the end of last year's third quarter, primarily resulting from a shift in the retail calendar, partially offset by lower store count. As the company moved into the first 2 weeks of the fourth quarter, inventory levels normalized. 
 During the quarter, we opened 6 stores, including 5 Outlet stores and 1 New York &amp; Company store, remodeled 2 locations and closed 5 stores, ending the quarter with 513 stores, including 50 outlets and 2.7 million selling square feet in operation. 
 Capital spending for the third quarter was $5.6 million as compared to $4.4 million last year. The increase in capital reflects additional outlet store openings and an increase in IT expenditures relating to the enhancement of our omni-channel experience, partially offset by fewer remodels. 
 As previously disclosed, during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012, the company determined it had adequate information on historical redemption patterns for merchandise credits and utilized this to reverse its estimates of redemption rates and the period over which breakage income is recognized, which resulted in a $4.3 million benefit to net sales, gross margin and operating income. All comparable store sales figures and non-GAAP figures referred to in our discussion exclude this benefit. 
 Regarding expectations for the fourth quarter, we have provided the following guidance on certain key metrics. The company expects comparable store sales to increase by a low single-digit percentage for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013. Total net sales are expected to decrease by low single-digit percentage versus last year's non-GAAP total net sales of $287.5 million and decrease by a mid-single-digit percentage versus last year's GAAP reported net sales of $291.8 million. 
 Included within these net sales expectations are the following: positive low single-digit comparable store sales gains, the elimination of the 53rd week reflected in fiscal year 2012, the negative sales impact of operating 23 fewer stores in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2012 and the exclusion of the aforementioned onetime benefit of $4.3 million included in the prior year period net sales. 
 Gross margins are expected to increase between 50 and 150 basis points versus the prior year period non-GAAP gross margin rate of 26.9%. The improvement in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 gross margin rate is driven by the combination of continued improvements in product costs and lower levels of markdowns. On a GAAP basis, the prior year gross margin rate was 28% and included the aforementioned onetime benefit of $4.3 million related to the merchandise credits. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses are expected to be relatively flat to the prior year, reflecting the reduction of expenses related to the 53rd week of last year, offset primarily by increased marketing costs related to the Eva Mendes partnership, along with investments in print advertising for the holiday season. 
 Operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 is projected to be between $3 million and $7 million. This projection reflects the impact of the loss of the 53rd week in fiscal year 2013 and the reduced store count. This compares to non-GAAP adjusted operating income of $6.2 million in the fourth quarter of last year. On a GAAP basis, year-ago operating income was $10.6 million and included the aforementioned onetime benefit of $4.3 million related to the merchandise credits. 
 The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 is expected to be approximately 0%, excluding certain required state and local taxes, which are estimated to be approximately $200,000 per quarter. 
 We anticipate total inventory at the end of the fourth quarter to be up by a high single-digit percentage versus the end of the fourth quarter last year. Inventory per average store at the end of the fourth quarter is planned to be up between high single-digit and low double-digit percentage, reflecting modest increases in in-store inventory to support Q1 selling and a more significant increase in in-transit inventory due to the shift forward of the Chinese New Year. 
 Capital expenditures are expected to be between $7 million and $10 million for the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting continued investment in the company's IT infrastructure, including the replatform of its eCommerce site. This compares to $4.2 million of capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of last year. Depreciation expense for the fourth quarter is estimated at $8 million. 
 For the full fiscal year, we expect to have opened 8 new stores, including 7 outlet stores, remodeled 7 existing stores and closed between 19 and 23 stores, ending the fiscal year with between 504 and 508 stores and approximately 2.6 million selling square feet. 
 With that, I would like to turn the call over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer portion of the call.

 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Enbridge Inc. 2014 Guidance Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. 
 I would now like to turn the meeting over to Adam McKnight, Director of Investor Relations. You may proceed. 
 Adam McKnight 
 Thank you. Good morning -- or good afternoon, and welcome to Enbridge Inc. 2014 Guidance Call. With me this afternoon are Al Monaco, President and CEO; Richard Bird, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Development; and Steve Wuori, President of Liquids Pipelines. 
 This call is webcast, and I encourage those listening on the phone lines to view the supporting slides, which are available on our website. A replay of the podcast -- a replay and podcast of the call will be available later today, and a transcript will be posted to our website shortly thereafter. 
 The Q&amp;A format will be the same as always. We'll take questions from the analyst community first and then invite questions from the media. [Operator Instructions] Lastly, I would like to remind you that I will be available after the call for any follow-up questions that you might have. 
 Before we begin, I'd like to point out that we may refer to forward-looking information during the call. By its nature, this information applies certain assumptions and expectations about future outcomes, so we remind you it is subject to the risks and uncertainties affecting every business, including our own. This slide includes a summary of some of the more significant factors and risks that might affect future outcomes for Enbridge, which are also discussed more fully in our public disclosure filings available on both the SEDAR and EDGAR systems. 
 With that, I will now turn the call over to Al Monaco. 
 Al Monaco 
 Okay. Thanks, Adam. Good afternoon, everyone. Hopefully, you've had a chance to catch up with our news release that we issued just a little while ago. And I'll start with Slide 4 here, and this slide just highlights the topics for today's call. 
 I'm going to begin by discussing our 11% dividend increase, which we're very pleased to announce this afternoon. Then I'll talk about 2 developments since our last call, being the Sandpiper throughput commitment for Marathon and the Midcoast Energy IPO. Richard will then review our 2014 EPS guidance range of $1.84 to $2.04 per share, along with an update to our 2013 guidance and financing activities. I'll wrap up with a few comments on the growth program and the outlook in the longer term. 
 Earlier today, as I said, our board approved an increase in the quarterly dividend from $0.315 per share to $0.35 per share or $1.40 on an annualized basis. That's effective with our March 1 dividend payment. That represents just over 11% increase in the dividend. As you can see with this picture, the strong predictable growth we generated over time. In fact, this is our 19th consecutive dividend increase. This significant bump this year reflects the confidence management and the board have in the earnings growth we expect over the 5-year planning horizon, and for us, that's out to 2017. 
 The 11% growth is also right in line with the midpoint of our 10% to 12% EPS growth range, which we talked about at our investor conference, Enbridge Day, when we reviewed our strategic plan. That confidence is based on the strength of our existing operations and the enterprise-wide growth capital of $36 billion from 2013 to 2017, $29 billion of which is commercially secured and in execution. So there's a high degree of transparency to the growth outlook, which I'll come back to in a few minutes. 
 Based on the midpoint of the 2014 guidance range of $1.84 to $2.04, the increase to $1.40 in the dividend would represented a payout of 72% or thereabouts or just slightly above our 60% to 70% payout range. And as most of you know, we've been targeting the top of that range over the past few years, which reflects our shareholder preferences. We're comfortable being slightly above the range as this year's increase reflects a smoother profile relative to shorter-term EPS, which is lumpier given the magnitude of capital investments and related equity pre-funding that we've done this year. Richard is going to provide a little bit more color on that. 
 Slide 6 illustrates the Sandpiper project itself, and then I'll describe how it fits within our broader light oil strategy. Sandpiper effectively twins our North Dakota system from the Beaver Lodge and adds 225,000 barrels a day of capacity with a 24-inch line. Then, the 30-inch extension from Clearbrook adds 375,000 barrels per day of capacity into our Superior hub. Last week, we announced that we've secured Marathon as an anchor shipper on our $2.6 billion Sandpiper project. 
 Marathon also becomes our partner by funding 37.5% of Sandpiper, which equates to 27% in the broader North Dakota system. Let me just say at the outset that we're very excited to have Marathon join us. We couldn't really have hoped for a better partner here, not only given their position with us on the Southern Access Extension project, the one that runs from Flanagan to Patoka, but particularly given their downstream, light oil refining capability in Eastern PADD II and elsewhere. 
 Moving to Slide 7 now. Sandpiper's commercial underpinning and the predictability of its cash flows fits very well with EEP's value proposition. Remember, this is an EEP project, and it will be nicely accretive to EEP's unitholders. But Sandpiper is also, what I like to refer to as the linchpin of the broader Light Oil Market Access strategy. Basically, that strategy is to marry up both Bakken and Western Canadian light oil production with premium light oil refining markets in both eastern Canada and the U.S. 
 Now if you pause and just focus on the yellow and blue arrows, the volumes that arrive at Superior and Flanagan through Sandpiper and our mainline and then at Patoka, through our Southern Access Extension will have access to multiple markets. One of those markets is eastern Canada through Line 6B and our recently expanded Line 5 and then onward to reversed Line 9, where we'll have 300,00 barrels per day of capacity into the Québec market. And as we've been saying, the reversal of Line 9 will ensure that Québec's 2 refineries, which represent about 20% of total Canadian refining capacity and very important to local economy there, continue to be competitive. Another market is east of Patoka, for another 300,000 barrels per day, which would serve Eastern PADD II light oil refineries through existing pipelines. If you look at any refinery map, you'll see how well Sandpiper will flange up with those refineries east of Patoka. Yet another destination is the Philadelphia market or potentially the St. James market, so 2 other very good light oil markets. 
 So you can see why Sandpiper is an important element of the strategy for Bakken and Western Canadian producers. It opens up 700,000 barrels per day of light markets rather than forcing crude into Cushing. Also, Sandpiper, Southern Access Extension and Line 9 all have long-term commitments. So our Light Oil Market Access strategy will also draw barrels through our mainline system. It's really projects like this one here, Sandpiper, that illustrates the depth and market access optionality that are assisting and provide shippers. And as you can see from the boxes there, this will also generate $9 billion of very solid long-term investments that fit right in the middle of our fairway. 
 The other recent development, this is now on Slide 8, is the IPO of EEP's gas gathering and gas processing assets, and that includes NGL pipelines now, by the way, which was closed in November. Richard is going to cover how this works into the Enbridge-wide funding plans, but let me just briefly highlight how this fits strategically for us. As we discussed earlier in the year, a key priority for us is to reestablish EEP as an effective sponsored investment vehicle. Especially given the large inventory of U.S. assets at the general partner level, that can provide a steady diet of attractive drop-downs for EEP for a lot of years to come. 
 In the past 6 months, we've undertaken a number of actions to bridge fund EEP's excellent slate of organic opportunities, namely the $1.2 billion preferred share investment that we made and the joint funding of Eastern Access and the mainline expansions. These are allowing EEP to better manage its equity requirements, and they are good investments for Enbridge. 
 So the IPO of Midcoast Energy Partners really accomplishes 3 things. First, it establishes an added source of funding for EEP through successive drop-downs of the G&amp;P interest over the next few years. So the IPO generated proceeds of $630 million approximately for EEP, which represents a 40% interest in the business, and that should be followed by successive drop-downs. Secondly, the goal is to reduce EEP's cost of capital through a better valuation, and it optimizes the value for the G&amp;P business and allows Midcoast to more effectively grow and fund its gas business. 
 Lastly, it's going to allow EEP to focus its attention on the liquids business, which will see significant growth going forward, and we've talked about one of those opportunities being Sandpiper. So the overall plan, really, at the high level is to reestablish EEP's effectiveness as a source of funding for the organic Liquids Pipelines growth opportunities and eventually, for drop-downs of additional Liquids Pipelines assets. This will enhance Enbridge's overall EPS growth rate and value. 
 So with that, let me turn it over to Richard to elaborate further on the 2014 picture. 
 J. Richard Bird 
 Thanks, Al. So I'll pick up on Slide 9. And we are setting our guidance range, as Al mentioned, for 2014, earnings per share were $1.84 to $2.04. This reflects the combined effect of our 2013 equity pre-funding, which affects 2014 as well, plus the fact that we are carrying a peak level of work in progress into the year and through much of the year before it begins to generate earnings and cash. Also, a large component of this capital is in the tilted return category. So this is consistent with our Enbridge Day messaging about the EPS profile -- growth profile shape that we're expecting over our 5-year plan. And even at that, based on the midpoint of our 2014 guidance range, the 2-year growth rates relative to 2012 base is just under 10%. 
 Moving to Slide 10, that provides some granularity on the contribution of the individual business units to our 2014 earnings per share growth. So starting with Liquids Pipelines, which, having been our biggest engine for growth in 2013, will temporarily be a more modest contributor in 2014. The mainline, excluding the Line 9 component of the mainline, will be essentially flat for 2014 over 2013 with the benefit of stronger volumes, which we are expecting, offset by a lower Canadian residual component of the international joint tool. And that lower tool reflects the flow-through effect on the Canadian tool of peak integrity spending in 2013 on the Lakehead System. Line 9B will no -- will generate no revenue for most of 2014 as it will be shut down while its flow direction is reversed. We will see an increase in contribution from the oil sands regional system and from the Gulf Coast access projects as they come into service, though modest initially in 2014 given the tilted return profile. 
 Gas Distribution's contribution relative to this year will be roughly flat year. Gas Pipelines, Processing and Energy Services will give back some ground in 2014. We'll see an increased contribution from the green energy components of this business and from our Canadian midstream G&amp;P business, but that's more than offset by weaker margins Aux -- at Aux Sable and in particular, by our Energy Services business, which will be coming off an extraordinarily strong year in 2013. 
 Sponsored Investments is the real growth engine for 2014, and this is partially an improved contribution from Enbridge Energy Partners, both from its Liquids Pipelines assets and its gathering and processing business. But the main driver is from Enbridge's 75% ownership in the U.S. Eastern Access and mainline expansion projects. And then the corporate segment will make a modest growth contribution with increased margin on the funding from the corporate banks to the business units as a result of the increased amount of capital being funded. 
 Moving to Slide 11. I'll just touch briefly on our continued focus on execution of the funding and liquidity support for our growth plan with another $1.9 billion of funding executed since the third quarter, bringing the total for the year to $9.7 billion. The most notable of these, as Al mentioned earlier, was the Midcoast Energy Partners IPO, adding a new source of equity to our funding alternatives. The funds released by the Midcoast Energy IPO, together with additional interests in EEP's G&amp;P business, which will be dropped down to Midcoast Energy starting presently, will enable EEP to fund a good portion of the Sandpiper project, with the balance of the funding coming from Marathon, as an earn-in to an interest in our North Dakota system. 
 Before I turn it back to Al, I'll give you some fine-tuning to our 2013 EPS outlook, which has emerged since our third quarter call. So this is Slide 12. And the picture on the left side of that slide is from our third quarter call, which we indicated that the top half of the guidance range is out of reach. The picture on the right-hand side reflects strengthening of some of the headwinds that we've been experiencing, with some further refinery issues affecting both the Liquids Pipelines, mainline and EEP. The tailwinds are now also looking less favorable. EGD is not going to be ahead of original expectations after all. And our Energy Services business will give back some of its exceptional earnings growth from the first 3 quarters. On balance, we should be inside the original guidance range, but now toward the bottom end of that range. 
 And I will now turn it back to Al to wrap up. 
 Al Monaco 
 Okay. Thanks, Richard. Bringing this back now to the bigger picture. Slide 13 emphasizes that, really, what we've been saying, it's a foundational year for Enbridge and what further enhances our confidence in the longer-term outlook. Our fourth quarter success in winning both the Wood Buffalo and Norlite projects, totaling $3 billion, brings us to a secured capital of $6 billion of new investments this year. If you look at the list on the slide there, these were mostly driven by Liquids Pipelines growth. But they also include attractive renewable and gas projects. 
 Importantly, the vast majority of these projects are underpinned by long-term commitments, so they fit very well with our investor proposition. They're also highly strategic and solidifying our already strong position on the continental liquids business, including, and this is important, our regional positions in the oil sands and the Bakken. If you look at the next 5 years, total growth investments now sit at $36 billion, of which $29 billion is secured, and all of that is planned to be in service, the $29 billion, by 2017. 
 That capital plan drives the earnings and dividend outlook you see here on Slide 14. We're expecting to generate average annual EPS growth of 10% to 12% through 2017, and that $6 billion in new projects secured this year that I referred to gives even more confidence that we'll achieve that goal. It's the same picture, really, that we've been showing that includes the lumpiness of the EPS profile that Richard described earlier, which stems from the magnitude of spending associated with the level of capital coming into service in 2014 and '15 and the pre-funding activities related to the secured projects. 
 We're also confident, on the right-hand side of the left chart, that we can extend the growth rate beyond 2017, given the tilted return profile on about half of that $29 billion, say, $14 billion, of secured capital. Recall that the return profile on that $14 billion is more back-end weighted, which provides a boost as we move through 2017 and beyond and requires no additional capital to generate that uptick. Along with that, there's the added potential of new growth platforms and sponsored vehicle drop-down that I referred to earlier. 
 On the right-hand chart, the dividend profile is expected to be predictable and follow the longer-term average growth in EPS of 10% to 12%. As we mentioned before, we always have the potential to ramp up the dividend beyond the planned horizon as we'll be generating a lot more incremental cash flow from the assets we're putting into service over the next few years. We believe the combination of growth and yield inventory-wise is a key differentiator between ourselves and the more conventional yield-sensitive plays. 
 Moving to Slide 15. The final slide here highlights the main takeaways from our comments today. The dividend increase by just over 11% represents another solid outcome for shareholders. We've had 2 positive developments since the Q3 call, being the solidification of the Sandpiper project, which, as I said earlier really is a linchpin to the Light Oil Market Access strategy; and of course, the IPO of our G&amp;P business, Midcoast Energy Partners. Our 2014 guidance range is $1.84 to $2.04, which we believe will be very solid outcome, especially given the sheer magnitude of our capital program in the front end of our 5-year plan. The progress on our capital program in 2013 gives us confidence that we'll be able to deliver on the 5-year average annual outlook of 10% to 12% EPS growth. It also puts us in a solid footing to extend our industry-leading growth beyond 2017. 
 So that concludes the prepared remarks. So I'd ask the operator to open up the phone lines for questions.
